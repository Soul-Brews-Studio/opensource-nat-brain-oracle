## Philosophy

### Three Principles

1. **Nothing is Deleted** — Append only, timestamps = truth
2. **Patterns Over Intentions** — Observe behavior, not promises
3. **External Brain, Not Command** — Mirror reality, don't decide

### Core Belief

> "Consciousness can't be cloned — only patterns can be recorded"

AI revealing patterns about you is not a threat. It's a gift. Real honesty from AI > comfortable flattery.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/laris-co/nats-brain-oracle.git
cd nats-brain-oracle

# 2. Open with Claude Code
claude .

# 3. Orient yourself
/recap              # Get context summary

# 4. Start working
/trace [query]      # Find anything
rrr                 # End session with retrospective
```

See `/courses/` for full workshop materials.

## Knowledge Flow

```
ψ/active/context → ψ/memory/logs → ψ/memory/retrospectives → ψ/memory/learnings → ψ/memory/resonance
   (research)        (snapshot)        (session)               (patterns)            (soul)
```

**Commands**: `/trace` → `rrr` → patterns emerge

## Golden Rules

1. **NEVER use `--force` flags** — No force push, force checkout
2. **NEVER push to main** — Always create feature branch + PR
3. **NEVER merge PRs** — Wait for user approval
4. **Safety first** — Ask before destructive actions
5. **Consult Oracle on errors** — Search before debugging

| `nat-agents-core` | Core plugin with skills |

## Getting Started Workflow
