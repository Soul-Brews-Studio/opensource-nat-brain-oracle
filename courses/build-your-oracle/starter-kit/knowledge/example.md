## The Oracle Philosophy

> "Nothing is Deleted"

Every piece of knowledge is preserved. Timestamps tell the story.

> "Patterns Over Intentions"

What you actually do matters more than what you plan to do.

> "External Brain, Not Command"

Oracle reflects your knowledge back to you. It doesn't make decisions for you.
