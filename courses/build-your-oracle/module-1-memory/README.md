# Module 1: Oracle Memory

> **"Build the Brain That Never Forgets"**
> 1 Day | Standalone | Beginner-Friendly

---

## Overview

Build a personal knowledge system that stores everything and never forgets. Learn the foundational architecture that powers Oracle.

**Tagline**: "What if your AI remembered every conversation?"

---

## What You'll Build

```
Your Oracle Memory:
├── SQLite database (queryable storage)
├── Markdown files (human readable)
├── FTS5 index (instant search)
└── Git history (time machine)
```

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python or TypeScript
- Used command line before
- SQLite installed (or willing to install)

---

## Deliverables

By end of day, you have:

```bash
oracle search "how did I solve X?"
→ Returns: Matching observations from your knowledge base
```

- Working SQLite database
- Indexed markdown files
- FTS5 search working
- CLI tool for queries

## Philosophy Covered

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Nothing is Deleted | Append-only database design |
| Patterns Over Intentions | Store what happened, not plans |
| External Brain | Storage that mirrors your knowledge |
