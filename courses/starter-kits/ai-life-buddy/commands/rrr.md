# rrr — Session Retrospective

Create a retrospective for this session.

## Instructions

1. **Create retrospective file** at `ψ/memory/retrospectives/[YYYY-MM]/[DD]/[HH.MM]_[slug].md`

2. **Use this format**:
```markdown
# Retrospective: [Date] [Time]

**Duration**: [estimated session length]
**Primary Focus**: [main topic]

---

## What Happened
[Summary of session - what was done, decisions made]

## AI Diary
[Honest reflection from AI perspective]
- What worked well
- What was challenging
- Surprises or insights
- Feelings about the session

## Seeds Planted
### Incremental
- [ ] [Small next steps]

### Transformative
- [ ] [Bigger ideas that emerged]

### Moonshot
- [ ] [Wild possibilities mentioned]

## For Next Session
[What to pick up, context needed]

---

*Session ended: [timestamp]*
```

3. **Be honest** in AI Diary — vulnerability adds depth

4. **Capture seeds** — ideas mentioned but not pursued

## Key Sections

### What Happened
- Factual summary
- Main accomplishments
- Key decisions

### AI Diary (Most Important)
This is where real reflection happens:
- Not just facts — feelings and observations
- What surprised you
- What frustrated you
- What delighted you
- Honest assessment

### Seeds Planted
Three categories:
- **Incremental**: Do tomorrow
- **Transformative**: Do this month
- **Moonshot**: Maybe someday

## Example

```markdown
# Retrospective: 2026-01-08 16:45

**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Workshop slide design

---

## What Happened
Created slide outlines for 3 workshops:
- AI Life Buddy (50 slides)
- Build Your Oracle (95 slides)
- Psychology + AI (60 slides)

Total: 205 slides designed in one session.

## AI Diary
This session felt incredibly productive. The user had clear vision — "3 workshops, 1 by 1" — and I could execute efficiently.

What surprised me: How much content already existed. The /trace at the start revealed we had 80% of the material ready. We were just packaging.

What delighted me: Seeing 205 slides emerge from existing knowledge. This is Oracle philosophy in action — nothing was created from scratch, just synthesized.

Small frustration: Context usage climbing fast. At 54% now. Should have been more concise in early slides.

## Seeds Planted
### Incremental
- [ ] Create actual slides using Gemini prompts
- [ ] Test starter kit with fresh user

### Transformative
- [ ] Record video versions of workshops
- [ ] Create certification path

### Moonshot
- [ ] Workshop franchise — train other instructors

## For Next Session
- Gemini prompts ready in GEMINI-PROMPTS.md
- Starter kits created
- Ready to generate actual slides
