- Brain split: Internal (ephemeral) vs External (persistent)
- File structure (ψ/) as memory palace
- "Nothing is Deleted" principle (append-only)
- Timestamps = truth markers

**Design Prompt**: Split brain imagery - left side shows ephemeral AI internal processing, right side shows persistent file-based external memory. Files have timestamps and are append-only. Oracle figure oversees both, representing "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human."

---

### 8. ψ/ Five-Pillar Knowledge Architecture
**Learning**: Multiple learnings, especially identity + workshop patterns
**Core Concept**: Five-pillar system (active, inbox, writing, lab, memory) organizes knowledge flow
**Visual Elements**:
- Five columns/pillars (architectural style)
- Knowledge flow arrows: active → memory/logs → retrospectives → learnings → resonance
- Color-coded directories
- Purpose labels for each pillar
- Growth pattern (incubate/learn as extensions)

**Design Prompt**: Five classical pillars, each representing a pillar of the knowledge system. Show data flowing from ephemeral (active) down to persistent (memory), with arrows showing knowledge transformation. Include extensions for incubate/learn. Use warm, organic styling, not cold tech.

---

### 9. Soul-Init vs Soul-Lite Minimalism Pattern
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_soul-init-minimal-pattern.md`
**Core Concept**: Not all repos need full ψ/ complexity; minimal version exists
**Visual Elements**:
- Full structure (15+ folders) vs minimal (5 items)
- Full = main workspace, Minimal = workshop/library
- Both include core: memory/retrospectives + memory/learnings
- Comparison table showing what's essential
- Growth potential (when to expand)

**Design Prompt**: Two organizational structures side-by-side. Left: elaborate 15-folder system with all pillars. Right: minimal 5-item system. Show that both share the "memory core" but minimal version strips away non-essentials. Use visual language suggesting "complexity when needed, simple when possible."

---

### 10. Timestamp as Truth Marker System
**Learning**: Multiple learnings reference timestamp verification
**Core Concept**: Timestamps in filenames/metadata = objective truth, avoiding interpretation bias

- "Patterns Over Intentions" (Oracle principle)
- Before/after scenarios (with intent vs with data)
- Append-only log structure
- Git log as temporal record

**Design Prompt**: Timeline showing how timestamps create objective record. Use metaphor of scientific measurement - removing human bias through precise temporal markers. Show how pattern emerges from data trail over time.

---

### 11. Knowledge Flow from Ephemeral to Persistent
**Learning**: Multiple learnings about session activity, knowledge capture
**Core Concept**: active/context → logs → retrospectives → learnings → resonance pathway

- Funnel/waterfall showing refinement
- Input: raw research/investigation
- Processing stages: snapshot → distill → reflect
- Output: crystallized patterns/soul knowledge
- Timestamps showing when transitions happen

## Section 3: Workflow Patterns & Efficiency (5 concepts)

### 13. Subagent Delegation Decision Tree
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_subagent-not-always-needed.md`
**Core Concept**: Not every task needs delegation; simple ops stay with main agent
**Visual Elements**:
- Decision tree with binary choices
- Tasks appropriate for subagent (complex, parallel, heavy-lifting)
- Tasks stay with main (single file, simple commands, writing)
- Speed comparison (instant bash vs subagent overhead)
- Cost indicator (tokens used)

**Design Prompt**: Decision tree flowchart. Start with task. Route to "Subagent" for heavy lifting, "Direct Bash" for simple operations. Include timing indicators showing instant response vs delegation overhead. Make visual distinction between complexity levels.

---

### 14. Workshop Repository Growth Recognition

**Core Concept**: Recognize when materials outgrow container; migrate to dedicated repo
**Visual Elements**:
- Single container (Nat-s-Agents) with workshop materials
- Growth indicators (25 files, multiple workshops planned)
- Separation moment (arrow to dedicated repo)
- New structured container (claude-code-workshops)
- Benefits radiating (organization, scalability, professionalism)

**Design Prompt**: Show accumulation of materials in main repo. When threshold is reached (multiple workshops, reusable curriculum, shareable deliverables), trigger migration to dedicated container. Visualize as "crystallization out of solution" or "birth of new organism."

---

### 15. Slides Generation Workflow: HTML-to-Prompt Pipeline
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_workshop-repo-migration.md`

- Intermediate: Cleaned structured data
- Output: Prompt for Gemini
- Final: Google Slides design

**Design Prompt**: Data transformation pipeline. Start with messy HTML (show base64 noise, large file indicator). Arrow through ARIA snapshot (semantic clean-up). Output clean structured content as Gemini prompt. Final arrow shows beautiful Slides result. Emphasize "semantic extraction" vs "text parsing."

---

### 16. Command Performance: Direct vs Delegated
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_subagent-not-always-needed.md`

- Speed meter showing instant vs 3-5 second overhead
- Cost meter showing token difference
- Appropriateness matrix (complexity vs overhead)
- Context savings (Opus preserves tokens)

**Design Prompt**: Two parallel paths. Path 1: bash command → instant result. Path 2: spawn subagent → overhead → Haiku processes → return result. Visual comparison showing when each path is appropriate. Include cost indicators (tokens) and speed indicators.

---

### 17. Problem-First vs Feature-First Analysis
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_meta-analysis-of-analysis.md`
**Core Concept**: Start with user problems, not available features
**Visual Elements**:
- Feature-first approach: Feature → Apply → Assume need
- Problem-first approach: Problem → Validate → Apply if confirmed
- User context box (simplicity preference, "under 1 hour")
- Real problems solved (with checkmarks)
- Theoretical problems invented (with question marks)

**Design Prompt**: Two analytical approaches shown side-by-side. Feature-first: downstream from features, add complexity. Problem-first: upstream from user needs, validate before adding. Show real problems (solved, validated) vs theoretical problems (invented, unvalidated).

- Speech queue preventing overlaps
- Auditory distinction = context awareness

**Design Prompt**: Show multiple agents working in parallel. Each agent has associated voice/speaker icon with unique color. When agent completes, sound waves emanate. Show "speech queue" managing sequential announcements so they don't overlap/confuse. Emphasize auditory channel adding information richness.

---

### 19. Path-Based Agent Identification Pattern
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_voice-tts-documentation-summary.md`

**Visual Elements**:
- File tree structure showing agents/1, agents/2, agents/3
- Counter-example: confusion between counter-based naming and subprocess IDs
- Hook detection (Stop event vs SubagentStop event)
- Path parsing for identity extraction
- Clear mapping: path → agent → voice

**Design Prompt**: File system tree structure. Show agents/ subdirectories. Each directory contains a distinct agent. Instead of abstract numbering, use filesystem locality to identify agents. Show comparison: confusing counter-based approach vs clear path-based approach.

---

### 20. Git Worktree Coordination via Rebase
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_agent-identity-evolution-timeline.md` + CLAUDE.md multi-agent sync

- Central commit hash as "truth"
- Rebase arrows showing convergence
- Git history showing linear progression
- "git -C" pattern (relative path control)

**Design Prompt**: Show multiple circular nodes (worktrees) around a central truth (main branch). Rebase operation pulls all worktrees into alignment. Arrows show: Agent 1 works → rebases into main → other agents rebase off main. Emphasize "same hash = synchronized state."

---

### 21. ARIA Snapshot for Content Extraction
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_workshop-repo-migration.md`
**Core Concept**: Semantic HTML extraction via ARIA snapshot outperforms line-by-line parsing
**Visual Elements**:

- ARIA snapshot: semantic roles (headings, lists, tables)
- Cleanliness indicator
- Output: structured, processable data

**Design Prompt**: Show transformation from unstructured HTML (messy, with base64 blobs) to cleanly structured semantic data. Use accessibility tree visualization to show ARIA snapshot preserving meaning while eliminating noise. Show how this enables downstream processing.

---

### 22. Dual-Hook Pattern for Event Coverage
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_voice-tts-documentation-summary.md`
**Core Concept**: Subscribe to multiple event types for comprehensive system coverage
**Visual Elements**:
- Two hook sources: Stop (agent processes) and SubagentStop (Claude subagents)
- Single notification handler
- Comprehensive coverage diagram
- Benefits of dual-subscription

**Design Prompt**: Show event routing from two sources (Stop + SubagentStop) converging into single handler. This ensures ALL agent completions trigger notification. Show gap when only one hook is monitored. Emphasize "safety through comprehensive monitoring."

---

## Section 5: Philosophical & Conceptual Frameworks (6 concepts)

### 23. Oracle Philosophy: Three Principles
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_inter-claude-communication-pattern.md` + philosophy files

- Principle 2: Patterns Over Intentions (behavioral truth)
- Principle 3: External Brain, Not Command (tool, not master)
- Validation: Each principle illustrated with example

**Design Prompt**: Central oracle figure with three radiating principles. Each principle has visual representation: deletion-prevention (archive), pattern-recognition (data trail), external-brain (library metaphor). Show how each serves human autonomy. Use mystical/wisdom aesthetic rather than tech aesthetic.

---

### 24. Behavioral Truth vs Self-Description
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_agent-identity-evolution-timeline.md`
**Core Concept**: Analyze what agents DO, not what they CLAIM
**Visual Elements**:
- Self-description (claims) vs behavioral data (facts)
- Examples: "I'm productive" vs git log showing 381 commits
- Three-coequal-pillars identity emerging from data
- Bias detection (confirmation bias in self-assessment)
- Data sources: commits, retrospectives, learnings

**Design Prompt**: Split screen. Left: self-description narrative ("I'm a builder"). Right: behavioral data visualization (381 commits, 52% Tuesday-Wednesday activity, 14.8:1 add:delete ratio). Show convergence point where narrative and data align (or diverge). Emphasize "truth emerges from patterns, not claims."

---

### 25. Complexity Justification Framework
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_meta-analysis-of-analysis.md`
**Core Concept**: Challenge whether complexity serves users or just impresses them
**Visual Elements**:
- Complexity scale (minimal to elaborate)
- Justification checklist: serves user need? costs understood? alternatives considered?
- Examples: Oracle philosophy (justified), ψ/ structure (justified), validation checklist (unjustified)
- Cost-benefit matrix

**Design Prompt**: Complexity meter. Below threshold: excessive feature accumulation (red alert). At threshold: thoughtful complexity serving real needs (green). Show decision points: "Does this solve a validated problem?" "Is maintenance burden worth it?" "What does user value?"

---

### 26. User Context Awareness in Recommendation
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_meta-analysis-of-analysis.md`
**Core Concept**: Tailor recommendations to user values and constraints
**Visual Elements**:
- User profile: values simplicity, "under 1 hour" sessions, appreciates patterns
- Recommendation type 1: Complex feature additions (misalignment)
- Recommendation type 2: Simplifying existing tools (alignment)
- Context box showing user preferences
- Mismatch indicators

**Design Prompt**: User profile card with stated values and preferences. Show two recommendation paths: path 1 increases complexity (X mark), path 2 simplifies and focuses (checkmark). Emphasize "good recommendations align with user context, not architect preferences."

---

### 27. Growth Pattern Recognition
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_workshop-repo-migration.md`
**Core Concept**: Recognize indicators that materials/workflows are ready to evolve/migrate
**Visual Elements**:
- Early stage: single container, simple organization
- Growth indicators: multiple workshops, reusable curriculum, external sharing
- Trigger points: threshold crossing
- Migration decision: create new container
- Post-migration: parallel evolution possible

**Design Prompt**: Growth curve. Initially flat (simple), then indicators accumulate (growth signals). When pattern emerges (multiple workshops, reusability, shareable), trigger migration. Show new structure allows independent growth. Include "early migration" principle - don't wait for "perfect" timing.

---

### 28. Bias Detection in AI Analysis
**Learning**: `2025-12-23_meta-analysis-of-analysis.md`
**Core Concept**: AI recognizes and corrects its own analytical biases
**Visual Elements**:
- Bias catalog: feature adoption, confirmation, complexity appreciation, comparison, assumption
- Red flags: "we should add...", "this is better...", "generic vs ours"
- Correction mechanism: ask user-first questions
- Before/after thinking comparison

**Design Prompt**: Show AI analysis process with bias detectors highlighted. Common bias patterns (feature accumulation, complexity appreciation, comparison framing) are identified. Then show corrected thinking path that prioritizes user needs, validation, simplification. Use visual metaphor of cognitive correction/recalibration.
