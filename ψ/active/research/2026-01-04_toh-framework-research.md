## Executive Summary

Toh Framework is a **free, open-source SaaS Builder AI Agent Framework** (v1.7.0) that enables non-programmers to build production-ready web applications using natural language. Created by Wasin Treesinthuros, it positions itself as a DIY tool for rapid MVP development.

**Key Finding**: Toh Framework is **complementary, not competitive** to our courses. It's a tool (like Claude Code), while we teach skills that work with any tool.

## Positioning vs Our Courses

### Toh Framework
- **Product Type**: Tool/Framework (like n8n, Claude Code)
- **What It Gives**: Ready-made framework
- **User Outcome**: Build apps with Toh
- **Dependency**: High (locked to Toh)
- **Price**: Free (OSS)
- **Approach**: ให้ปลา (Give fish)

### Our AI Builder Workshop
- **Product Type**: Course/Training
- **What It Gives**: Skills + Methodology
- **User Outcome**: Build apps with ANY tool
- **Dependency**: Low (tool-agnostic)
- **Price**: ฿3,900-4,900
- **Approach**: สอนตกปลา (Teach fishing)

## Key Insight: Complementary, Not Competitive

### Why They're Different

| Dimension | Toh Framework | Our Course |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Goal** | Provide a tool | Teach a skill |
| **Output** | Toh-based apps | Any-tool apps |
| **After 1 month** | Still using Toh | Can use Claude Code, Cursor, any AI tool |
| **After 1 year** | Toh updates matter | Tool-independent |
| **Lock-in** | Framework-specific | Zero lock-in |

### Potential Synergy

Wasin is teaching **"Claude Code Master Class for Business"** which likely covers:
- Sub Agents
- Skills
- Commands
- MCP

**Hypothesis**: He's teaching people HOW to use tools (like Toh Framework) with Claude Code.

This is similar to our approach but focused on his framework.

## Competitive Analysis

### Strengths vs Our Course

| Toh Strength | Our Counter |
|--------------|-------------|
| Free & open source | Higher value (transferable skills) |
| 10-20 min builds | Same-day prototype + understanding |
| Production-ready output | Production-ready + ability to modify |
| Large community (potential) | Personal attention + any domain |

### Weaknesses vs Our Course

| Toh Weakness | Our Advantage |
|--------------|---------------|
| Framework lock-in | Tool-agnostic skills |
| Limited to Toh capabilities | Build anything with any tool |
| No skill transfer | Skills last forever |
| If Toh changes/dies, you're stuck | Your skills work with future tools |

## Opportunity Analysis

### What We Can Learn

1. **Speed matters** - 10-20 min demos are compelling
2. **Show examples** - Real apps built (with time stamps) build trust
3. **Clear 3-step process** - Simple mental model
4. **Target pain points** - Address specific fears

### How We Differentiate

| Feature | Toh | Us |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **Promise** | "Build SaaS without coding" | "Build ANYTHING without coding" |
| **Tool** | Toh Framework only | Claude Code, Cursor, any AI tool |
| **Learning** | How to use Toh | How AI-assisted building works |
| **1 year later** | Know Toh | Know AI building principles |
| **New problem** | Hope Toh supports it | Build it yourself |

## Recommendations

### Don't Compete On
- Price (they're free, we charge for education)
- Framework features (different product types)
- "Build apps fast" alone (they have this too)

### Compete On
1. **Skill Transfer** - Learn once, use forever with any tool
2. **Independence** - Not locked to one framework
3. **Understanding** - Know WHY, not just HOW
4. **Flexibility** - Build solutions Toh doesn't support
5. **Live Support** - Real instructor, real-time help

### Consider
- **Partnership potential**: Toh Framework could be ONE of the tools we teach
- **Market education**: They're teaching market that AI building is possible
- **Different segments**:
  - Toh attracts: "I want to build this one thing fast"
  - We attract: "I want to learn how to build anything"

## Key Differentiators (Updated)

| # | Our Differentiator | Message |
|---|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | **SKILL over TOOL** | เรียนรู้หลักการ ไม่ใช่ติด framework |
| 2 | **ANY TOOL over ONE TOOL** | ใช้ได้ทั้ง Claude Code, Cursor, Toh, อะไรก็ได้ |
| 3 | **UNDERSTANDING over TEMPLATES** | รู้ว่าทำไม ไม่ใช่แค่รู้ว่าทำยังไง |
| 4 | **LIVE over SELF-SERVE** | มีครูช่วย ไม่ใช่อ่านเอง |
| 5 | **FOREVER over NOW** | Skills ที่ใช้ได้ตลอดชีวิต |

---

## One-Line Summary

| Product | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Toh Framework** | "Free framework to build SaaS with AI" |
| **Our Course** | "Learn to build ANYTHING with ANY AI tool" |

---

## Conclusion

Toh Framework is a **powerful free tool** that validates the market demand for AI-assisted building. Rather than competing, we should position ourselves as teaching the **skills to use tools like Toh** (and others) effectively.

**Our unique value**: Tool-agnostic AI building skills that last a lifetime.
