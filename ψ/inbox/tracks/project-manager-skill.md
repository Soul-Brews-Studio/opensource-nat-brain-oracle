# Track: project-manager Skill

**Status**: ✅ Built, needs testing
**Updated**: 2026-01-07 23:23

## What Was Done

- Built `.claude/skills/project-manager/` with 4 scripts
- learn.sh, incubate.sh, spinoff.sh, reunion.sh
- Reunion pattern: connect → talk → update → index → note

## Next Actions

1. [ ] Test `learn.sh` on real repo
2. [ ] Test `incubate.sh` auto-create
3. [ ] Create `/rrr --rich` command (full context)
4. [ ] Create `/rrr --direct` command (no search, just dump)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Via skill
/project learn pocketbase/pocketbase

# Or direct script (for debugging)
# .claude/skills/project-manager/scripts/learn.sh pocketbase/pocketbase
```
