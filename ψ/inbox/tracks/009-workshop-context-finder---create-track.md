## Goal

**NEW FRAMING**: Workshop = "Build Your Own Oracle" (not "Learn context-finder")

**Why**: People want to build knowledge systems, not learn technical patterns
**How**: context-finder naturally emerges when building Oracle (memory → search → synthesis)

**Core insight you shared**:
> "I just want to understand the importance of context-finder"
> → Show importance through **necessity**, not features

**Target**: Developers who want personal AI knowledge systems (like Oracle)

## Current State

**Brainstormed** full workshop structure (3 hours core + 2 hours advanced):
- Part 1: The Problem (real numbers: $1.50 → $0.08)
- Part 2: Architecture (three-layer model)
- Part 3: Hands-On (build simplified /trace)
- Part 4: Advanced Patterns (rrr, progressive loading, Oracle hints)
- Part 5: ROI Calculator

**Evidence from /trace analysis**:
- 17/34 commands (50%) use context-finder
- 18 git commits documenting evolution
- 10+ retrospectives proving value
- 95% cost reduction demonstrated

## Next Action

**Validation Phase** (before building materials):
1. Answer 3 questions:
   - Would I pay $500 for this?
   - Can I name 3 companies who need this now?
   - Do I have 10-20 hours for development?

2. If YES → Next steps:
   - Outline detailed curriculum
   - Build sample code repository
   - Record pilot session (beta testers)
   - Choose platform (Maven/Teachable/own site)

## Context

**Source**: /trace analysis showing context-finder = 50% of subagent infrastructure
**Workshop tiers**:
- Core (3h): $500/person - basic implementation
- Advanced (5h): $1200/person - + Oracle MCP
- Enterprise (2d): Custom - full system setup

**Marketing angle**: "Stop Paying Opus Prices for Haiku Work"
