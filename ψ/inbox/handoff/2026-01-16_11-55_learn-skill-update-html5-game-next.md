# Handoff: /learn Skill Update + HTML5 Game Idea

**Date**: 2026-01-16 11:55
**Context**: 88%

## What We Did

### Skills Fixed
- `/physical` — symlink → real directory (Claude Code doesn't follow symlinks)
- `/draft` — skill.md → SKILL.md (case sensitive)

### Blog Written
- `ψ/writing/drafts/2026-01-16_the-skill-that-saved-itself.md`
- Story of recovering both skills + Oracle philosophy

### /learn Skill Updated
- Changed format to match Nat's style (tables + explanation)
- Iterated 3 times: too verbose → too short → just right
- **REVERT NEEDED**: User wants previous version back
- New version at: `ψ/learn/LowLevelDigger-v2/` (206 lines, 4 files)
- Old version at: `ψ/learn/LowLevelDigger/` (481 lines, 4 files)

### Oracle Logged
- 5+ learnings about skill discovery
- Trace sessions logged

## Pending

- [ ] **REVERT /learn skill** to previous verbose version
- [ ] Commit all changes (skills, blog, learnings)
- [ ] Publish blog post

## Next Session: HTML5 2D Game

User wants to create a **plain HTML5 2D game** — no framework, raw canvas.

Ideas inspired by LowLevelDigger:
- Physics-based gameplay
- Particle systems
- Scoop/dig mechanics

**Next steps**:
1. Revert /learn to previous version
2. Discuss game concept (what kind of 2D game?)
3. Start prototyping in HTML5 Canvas

## Key Files

- `~/.claude/skills/learn/SKILL.md` — Current (needs revert)
- `ψ/learn/LowLevelDigger/` — Old format reference
- `ψ/learn/LowLevelDigger-v2/` — New format (user prefers old)
- `ψ/writing/drafts/2026-01-16_the-skill-that-saved-itself.md` — Blog draft

## Git Status

Uncommitted:
- Skills restored (physical, draft)
- /learn skill updated
