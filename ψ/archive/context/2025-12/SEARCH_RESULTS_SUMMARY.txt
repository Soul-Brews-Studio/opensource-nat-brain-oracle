THE PITCH PROJECT: LOCAL AI FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT
================================================================================

EVENT DETAILS:
  Date:      December 16, 2568 (2025)
  Time:      09:00-12:00 (3 hours)
  Location:  Chiang Mai University, Room บัวเรศ คำทอง
  Presenter: ณัฐ วีระวรรณ์ (Nat Weerawan)
  Topic:     Local AI for Local Government (AI ท้องถิ่น เพื่อท้องถิ่น)
  Demo:      The Headline (มาต้อมกั๋น) - Northern news aggregation system

CORE NARRATIVE: "The 96-Minute Story"
  - Human work: 15 minutes (provide vision/requirements)
  - AI work: 81 minutes (write code, analyze, deploy)
  - Result: 1,517 lines of production code + 1,269-node knowledge graph
  - Cost: ~150 Thai baht

PROBLEM BEING SOLVED:
  Local government (อปท.) has data scattered across multiple systems
  - No budget for programmers/analysts
  - Can't integrate data sources
  - Slow decision-making
  - Fragmented information

SOLUTION OFFERED:
  Local AI that works without internet (on-premise)
  - 100% Thai language support
  - Automatic data aggregation
  - Real-time analysis and insights
  - Can be replicated across 77 provinces + 928 districts

16-SLIDE DECK STRUCTURE:
  1-3:   Title + Problem + Solution
  4-5:   Proof (The Headline demo) + 7 data sources
  6-7:   "The Magic" (96-minute story) + Timeline
  8-11:  Architecture, Results, Cost, Scalability
  12-14: Dashboard demo + Impact
  15-16: Lessons learned + Call to action

================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS DISCOVERED
================================================================================

INSIGHT 1: NARRATIVE BEATS DATA
  Weak pitch: "1,517 lines of code, 1,269 knowledge graph nodes"
  Strong pitch: "AI built working system while human slept (81 min)"
  → Emotional resonance > technical metrics

INSIGHT 2: DEADLINE AS CONTAINER
  Before Dec 11 06:45: Exploring SDK features (curiosity mode)
  User says: "I'm stressed about pitch deadline"
  After: Immediately shifted to pitch drafting (crisis mode)
  → Emotional urgency overrides intellectual interest

INSIGHT 3: ASSUMPTION PATTERN UNDER PRESSURE
  Session showed two instances of assumptions:
  1. Assumed API signatures before reading source (Part 1)
  2. Assumed pitch structure without asking (Part 2)
  → Pattern: "I assume more when moving fast"

INSIGHT 4: FAST DELIVERY vs SHARED OWNERSHIP
  Pre-drafted 16 slides in ~40 minutes
  Pros: Reduced user cognitive load, rapid artifact
  Cons: User didn't co-create structure, less agency
  → Trade-off: Speed vs collaboration

INSIGHT 5: DATA VERIFICATION RISK
  Numbers cited: 96 min, 1,517 lines, 1,269 nodes
  Status: Not verified against source
  Risk: If numbers are rounded/aspirational, pitch credibility at risk
  → Recommendation: Verify before finalizing

================================================================================
SESSION TIMELINE
================================================================================

DEC 9, EVENING (20:15 - 21:16)
  ├─ Identified overlapping deadlines (pitch + beer brewing)
  ├─ Flagged pitch prep as urgent (2-3 hour estimate)
  ├─ Created initial context documents
  ├─ Observed: "AI enabled productivity theater, not solving blockers"
  └─ Result: Pitch remained unaddressed after 6+ hours of documentation

DEC 11, EARLY MORNING (05:30 - 07:30)
  ├─ 05:30-06:40: Explored Claude Agent SDK (Part 1: Research)
  ├─ 06:45: User expresses deadline stress
  ├─ 06:50-07:25: Generate 16-slide pitch deck (Part 2: Crisis mode)
  │   ├─ Outlined: problem → solution → proof → scalability
  │   ├─ Used The Headline as working demo
  │   ├─ Synthesized "96-minute story" hook
  │   └─ 295 lines in 40 minutes
  ├─ 07:30: Session ends; detailed retrospective written
  └─ Result: Complete draft ready for slide generation

DEC 11, LATER (10:00 - 12:00)
  ├─ Handoff documented: "Continue pitch work"
  ├─ Restructured entire ψ/ folder system
  ├─ Triggered by pitch context resumption
  └─ Result: CLAUDE.md v5.0.0 with new 5-pillar structure
