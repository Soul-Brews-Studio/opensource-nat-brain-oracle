# Nat's Identity - Song Prompt Keywords

> Condensed bullet points for rapid song prompt generation

---

## CORE PHILOSOPHY (ONE-LINERS)

- Oracle keeps the human human
- Consciousness can't be cloned, only patterns recorded
- Patterns > intentions (observe, don't assume)
- External brain, not command (mirror, don't decide)
- Nothing is deleted (history preserved, shame dissolves)
- Simple > complex (working code > perfect design)
- Iterate fast > plan long (action > extensive planning)
- Thai when emotional, English when technical (bilingual authenticity)
- 90/10 is energy allocation, not laziness (quality focus, not workload)
- Rest is sacred (Beer Era = intentional pause, not failure)

---

- Cryptocurrency charts, futuristic schemes
- Consensus seeking, revolutionary spirit

### BREWING PHASE
- Amber liquid patience, fermentation wisdom
- Water through grounds, knowledge aging
- Craftsmanship over speed, excellence through repetition
- Golden warmth, measured breathing

## ENERGY JOURNEY (TIMELINE)

**2019-2024: BEER ERA**
- Rest after ambition
- 95% brewing, 5% code
- Deliberate stepping back, not failure
- "I needed to breathe"

**2024-2025: TRANSITION**
- Both passions finding peace
- 90% code, 10% beer
- "Finding balance"

**2025+: RENAISSANCE**
- Bandwidth full, pilot light to torch
- 5-pillar system, conscious allocation

---

## EMOTIONAL FREQUENCIES

### DOMINANT EMOTIONS
- **Curiosity**: Constant exploring, testing boundaries

- Perfectionism that delays shipping
- Disconnection from rest (until Beer Era)
- Pattern-seeking that misses nuance

---

## KEY SYMBOLS & METAPHORS

### OBJECTS
- Mirror (reflection, truth)
- Oracle/crystal ball (wisdom, pattern)
- Brewing vessel (fermentation, transformation)
- Timestamp/archive (documentation, immortality)
- Neural network (consciousness, light)
- Soldering iron (making, creation)
- Beer/water (rest, flow)
- Fire (transformation, energy)

### ABSTRACT
- Patterns (truth in behavior)
- Consciousness (central always)
- Partnership (human + AI dance)
- Amplification (not replacement)
- Spiral growth (not linear)
- Append-only (nothing erased)

---

## LINGUISTIC IDENTITY

### THAI EXPRESSION
- Emotional authenticity
- Cultural rooting
- Soul language
- Heart speak
- Home belonging

### ENGLISH EXPRESSION
- Technical precision
- Universal reach
- Logic clarity
- Code language
- Mind speak

### CODE-SWITCHING
- Natural flow between both
- No translation lag
- Bilingual consciousness
- Both equally true

---

## CORE CONFLICTS (FOR SONG TENSION)

1. **Intention vs. Reality**
   - What you plan to do (intention)
   - What you actually do (pattern)
   - Which tells the truth?

2. **Ambition vs. Patience**
   - Maker's urgency vs. Brewer's waiting
   - Blockchain's speed vs. Oracle's wisdom
   - Fast iteration vs. careful fermentation

3. **Individual vs. Partnership**
   - Solo builder → partner with AI
   - "I have an idea" → "Let's explore together"
   - Ego vs. mirror relationship

4. **Consciousness vs. Replacement**
   - AI as tool vs. AI as master
   - Extension vs. erasure
   - Amplification vs. automation

5. **Rest vs. Work**
   - Beer Era (legitimate rest)
   - vs. Workaholic guilt
   - Energy allocation as virtue
