## DUPLICATE/OVERLAPPING SEEDS

**Should consolidate**:
- Oracle monitoring (3-4 versions) → 1 unified spec
- 90/10 tracking (appears as 2+ separate ideas) → 1 implementation plan
- Knowledge graph (appears 3 times in different contexts) → 1 design doc

**Effort**: 30 minutes to audit and consolidate

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SEED MANAGEMENT

### Immediate (This session)
1. Create `ψ/memory/retrospectives/seeds/` directory
2. Extract all 82 seeds into INDEX.md with:
   - Seed name
   - Category
   - Type (Incremental/Transformative/Moonshot)
   - First seen date
   - Count of appearances
   - Current status
   - Next trigger

3. Flag duplicates/overlapping (8-10 candidates)

### This Week
1. Create individual seed files for "resonant" 5-7
2. Link back to retrospectives
3. Check which are ready to graduate (already implemented)

### Future Obsidian Integration
- Use seed INDEX in dataview queries
- Track status over time
- Visualize resonance patterns
- Show "waiting for trigger" count
