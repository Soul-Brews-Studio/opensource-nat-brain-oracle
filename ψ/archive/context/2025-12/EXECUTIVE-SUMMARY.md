**Date**: 2025-12-11
**Researcher**: context-finder (Haiku)
**Scope**: Seeds planted analysis + Obsidian compatibility audit

## SEEDS RESEARCH

### Key Numbers
- **28 retrospectives** analyzed (2025-12-09 to 2025-12-11)
- **82+ seeds** identified across all sessions
- **5-7 resonant seeds** appearing 3+ times (high priority)
- **~15 already implemented** (graduated)

### Distribution by Type
| Type | Count | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Incremental | 35-40 | "Add more skills as patterns emerge" |
| Transformative | 15-20 | "Cellar as unified local brain" |
| Moonshot | 10-15 | "AI that truly knows Nat's full coding history" |

### Distribution by Category
| Category | Count | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Agent/Tool Extensions | 15 | Medium (infrastructure) |
| Knowledge Infrastructure | 12 | High (system needed) |
| Personal Productivity | 10 | Medium (personal) |
| Project-Specific | 12 | Medium (project-dependent) |
| Workshop/Teaching | 5-7 | Low (future) |
| Overlap/Duplicates | 8-10 | HIGH (consolidate now) |

### Top 5 Resonant Seeds

1. **Cellar: Unified Local Brain** (5 appearances)
   - Status: ACTIVE - Design phase
   - Type: Transformative
   - Impact: High (all tools use it)

2. **Oracle Monitoring System** (4 appearances)
   - Status: WAITING - Needs 90/10 formalization
   - Type: Transformative → Moonshot
   - Impact: High (personal productivity)

3. **Agent SDK Learning Labs** (3+ appearances)
   - Status: IN PROGRESS - Lab 001 complete
   - Type: Transformative
   - Impact: Medium (methodology)

4. **Learning System Overhaul** (3 appearances)
   - Status: PARTIAL - Pattern observed, not formalized
   - Type: Transformative
   - Impact: Medium (knowledge management)

5. **Knowledge Graph** (3 appearances)
   - Status: RESEARCH - Moonshot tier
   - Type: Moonshot
   - Impact: High (cross-project visibility)

### Current Problem
Seeds are scattered across 28 files with no unified index, making it hard to:
- Track which are duplicate/overlapping
- See patterns of emergence
- Monitor progress toward implementation
- Plan integration timing

## OBSIDIAN COMPATIBILITY

### Current Readiness: **5/10**

**What Works** (3/5 criteria met):
- Clear hierarchical structure ✓
- Markdown-only files ✓
- Existing metadata in filenames ✓

**What Doesn't Work** (2/5 criteria met):
- Zero wiki links [[]] ✗
- No consistent frontmatter ✗
- Inconsistent naming conventions ✗
- No inline tags ✗
- No backlinks between files ✗

### Obsidian Benefit Summary

| Area | Current | With Obsidian | Benefit |
|------|---------|---|---|
| Seed discovery | Manual search | Dataview queries | Find seeds in 5s vs 5m |
| Cross-linking | Text references | Graph visualization | See connections instantly |
| Metadata | Filename only | Queryable frontmatter | Sort by date/status/type |
| Navigation | Folder browsing | Breadcrumbs + graph | Know context + connections |
| Tagging | None | Inline tags | Track cross-cutting themes |

### Migration Effort Estimate

| Phase | Effort | Payoff | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|--------|---|
| Phase 1 (Frontmatter) | 2 hours | Medium | START NOW |
| Phase 2 (Structure) | 4 hours | High | WEEK 1 |
| Phase 3 (Integration) | 8 hours | Very High | MONTH 1 |
| **TOTAL** | **14 hours** | **Very High** | **Proceed** |

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Action (Today)

1. **Create `/ψ/memory/retrospectives/seeds/` directory**
   - Effort: 10 minutes
   - Payoff: Prepare infrastructure

2. **Create `seeds/INDEX.md` with all 82 seeds**
   - Columns: Name | Category | Type | Status | First-seen | Count | Trigger
   - Effort: 1-2 hours (can be rough)
   - Payoff: Unified view of all seeds

3. **Flag 8-10 duplicate seeds**
   - Effort: 30 minutes
   - Payoff: Know consolidation targets

### This Week

4. **Create individual files for top 5 resonant seeds**
   - Format: One seed file per resonant seed
   - Link back to retrospectives
   - Effort: 1 hour
   - Payoff: Track progress on high-impact items

5. **Start Phase 1 of Obsidian prep**
   - Add YAML frontmatter template to retrospectives
   - Apply to 5 most recent sessions
   - Effort: 1 hour
   - Payoff: See frontmatter working

### Next 2 Weeks

6. **Batch apply Phase 1 changes**
   - Frontmatter to all 28 retrospectives
   - Standardize file naming (ISO dates)
   - Add inline tags
   - Effort: 3 hours
   - Payoff: Full metadata readiness

## DECISION: OBSIDIAN YES/NO?

### Recommendation: YES

**Reasoning**:
1. Low migration cost (14 hours total)
2. High payoff (instant seed discovery, graph visualization)
3. Already markdown-first (no conversion needed)
4. Structure already supports it (ψ/ 5-pillar)
5. Solves real problem (scattered seeds → unified view)

**Start with Phase 1 this week** (2 hours of frontmatter).
**Evaluate after Phase 1** before committing to Phase 2.

## Key Takeaway

You have a strong, resonant seed garden growing (especially Cellar, Oracle, SDK labs). The issue isn't quality of ideas—it's **discoverability and tracking**.

Obsidian isn't a "nice to have"—it's the tool that makes your seed system actually *work* at this scale (82+ seeds, 28 retrospectives, 5+ active projects).

Start with Phase 1 this week. You'll see the value immediately.
