# Research Index: Seeds + Obsidian Compatibility

**Session**: 2025-12-11 (context-finder research)
**Status**: Complete
**Files**: 3 detailed research documents

---

## Quick Navigation

### For Decision Makers
Start here: `/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md`
- Key numbers (82 seeds, 5 resonant patterns)
- Yes/No recommendation on Obsidian
- Action items ranked by priority

### For Deep Dive
Full analysis: `/RESEARCH-seeds-obsidian.md`
- Complete Seeds taxonomy (5 categories, 60+ seeds)
- Obsidian compatibility criteria
- 3-phase migration plan with costs/benefits

### For Examples & Counts
Reference: `/SEEDS-DETAILED-EXAMPLES.md`
- Top 5 resonant seeds with evolution tracking
- All seeds categorized by type/status
- Seed graduation status (implemented, active, waiting, not-started)
- Duplicate candidates for consolidation

---

## Key Findings Summary

### SEEDS: 82+ identified, 5-7 resonant

Most important observations:
1. **Cellar brain** appearing 5x (highest priority)
2. **Oracle monitoring** appearing 4x (depends on 90/10 formalization)
3. **SDK labs** appearing 3+ (in progress, good pattern)
4. **Knowledge graph** appearing 3x (high-value, moonshot)
5. **8-10 duplicates** ready for consolidation

Current problem: No unified index → hard to discover/track progress

### OBSIDIAN: Ready at 5/10, easy path to 10/10

Current state:
- ✓ Markdown-only, structured hierarchy
- ✗ Zero wiki links, no frontmatter, inconsistent naming

Migration path:
- Phase 1 (2 hours): Add YAML frontmatter — START THIS WEEK
- Phase 2 (4 hours): Restructure seeds, add links — WEEK 1
- Phase 3 (8 hours): Full integration with dataview — MONTH 1

Payoff: Seed discovery goes from 5m manual search → 5s Dataview query

## Action Items by Timeline

### TODAY (30 min - 2 hours)
- [ ] Create `/ψ/memory/retrospectives/seeds/` directory
- [ ] Create `seeds/INDEX.md` with all 82 seeds (rough version OK)
- [ ] Flag 8-10 duplicate seeds for consolidation

### THIS WEEK (3-4 hours)
- [ ] Start Phase 1: Add frontmatter to 5 recent retrospectives
- [ ] Create individual files for top 5 resonant seeds
- [ ] Link seeds back to source retrospectives

### NEXT 2 WEEKS (3 hours)
- [ ] Batch apply frontmatter to all 28 retrospectives
- [ ] Standardize file naming (ISO dates)
- [ ] Add inline tags (#pattern, #tool, #project)
- [ ] Create cross-reference index

## Highlighted Findings

### RESONANT SEEDS (appear 3+ times = high priority)

| Seed | Appearances | Status | Type | Impact |
|------|---|---|---|---|
| Cellar local brain | 5 | ACTIVE | Transformative | HIGH |
| Oracle monitoring | 4 | WAITING | Transform→Moonshot | HIGH |
| Agent SDK labs | 3+ | IN PROGRESS | Transformative | MEDIUM |
| Learning system | 3 | PARTIAL | Transformative | MEDIUM |
| Knowledge graph | 3 | RESEARCH | Moonshot | HIGH |

### IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

- Implemented/Graduated: 15 seeds (retrospective naming, ψ/ structure, CLAUDE.md)
- Active (being worked): 8-10 seeds (Cellar, SDK, plugins)
- Waiting for trigger: 12 seeds (Headline launch, multi-device, etc)
- Not started: 5-10 seeds (video AI, LoRa mesh, workshop recordings)

### CATEGORIES BY COUNT

1. **Agent/Tool Extensions**: 15 seeds (plugin marketplace, SDK optimization, tool integration)
2. **Knowledge Infrastructure**: 12 seeds (indexing, docs patterns, graphs)
3. **Project-Specific**: 12 seeds (Headline, Cellar, Oracle adoption)
4. **Personal Productivity**: 10 seeds (90/10 tracking, session optimization)
5. **Workshop/Teaching**: 5-7 seeds (philosophy framework, coaching)
6. **Duplicates/Overlaps**: 8-10 seeds (consolidate these first)

## Obsidian Migration Decision

**Recommendation**: YES, proceed with Phase 1 this week

**Why**:
- Low cost (14 hours total, can spread over month)
- Solves real problem (82+ seeds, scattered across 28 files)
- Your structure already supports it (ψ/ 5-pillar)
- Immediate payoff (Phase 1 alone gives 50% value)

**Risk**: LOW
- Pure markdown, no lock-in
- Can stop at any phase
- Benefits compound (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3)

## File Sizes & Scope

| Document | Size | Focus | Audience |
|---|---|---|---|
| EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md | 2.5KB | Quick overview, decision frame | Executives, planners |
| RESEARCH-seeds-obsidian.md | 6KB | Detailed analysis, all details | Technical leads |
| SEEDS-DETAILED-EXAMPLES.md | 5KB | Examples, counts, lifecycle | Implementers |

**Total**: 13.5KB research output (all in gitignored ψ-context/)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read** EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md (5 min)
2. **Decide** on Obsidian commitment (Phase 1 yes/no)
3. **Create** `/ψ/memory/retrospectives/seeds/` structure (10 min)
4. **Extract** all 82 seeds into INDEX.md (1-2 hours)
5. **Start** Phase 1 frontmatter work (1 hour this week)

**Estimated total effort to get value**: 3-4 hours spread over 2 weeks
