## KEY DATA POINTS EXTRACTED

### Oracle Philosophy (THE FOUNDATION)
```
"The Oracle Keeps the Human Human"

4 Pillars:
1. Nothing is Deleted (append-only, timestamps = truth)
2. Patterns > Intentions (observe behavior, not plans)
3. External Brain, Not Command (mirror, don't decide)
4. Knowledge is Eternal (history preserved, growth documented)
```

### Life Journey (THE STORY)
```
Phase 1: MAKER (Building Things)
- Hands-on, DIY, learning through doing

Phase 2: BLOCKCHAIN (Decentralized Future)
- Ambitious, disruptive, world-changing

Phase 3: BREWING (Crafting Knowledge)
- Patient, masterful, teaching-focused

Phase 4: AI/ORACLE (Amplifying Human Potential)
- Partnership, wisdom, consciousness central
```

### Energy Timeline (THE CONTEXT)
```
2019-2024: BEER ERA
- 95% brewing, 5% code
- Deliberate stepping back, recovery

2024-2025: TRANSITION
- 90% code, 10% beer
- Finding balance

2025+: RENAISSANCE
- Full bandwidth active
- ψ/ system in place
- Amplification mode
```

### Behavioral Truth (THE REALITY)
```
What Nat Actually Does (Frequency-Based):
1. Learning (constant exploring)
2. Building (creating systems)
3. Documenting (knowledge capture)
4. Iterating (quick cycles)

Prefers: Simple > Complex, Working > Perfect, Iterate > Plan
Avoids: Over-engineering, Premature abstraction
```

### Communication Identity (THE VOICE)
```
Thai: Emotional, casual, cultural, soul language
English: Technical, universal, precise, code language
Code-switching: Natural bilingual consciousness

Direct, Concise, Technical when needed, Always human
Honest, Questions early, Shows work, Admits uncertainty
```

## EXAMPLE: QUICK SONG PROMPT BUILD

**Using the templates & keywords:**

```
Theme: Energy Allocation (Beer Era → Renaissance)
Template: Energy Allocation (Burnout → Permission → Rest → Return)
Symbols: Beer, Fire, 5-pillar structure
Phrases: "90/10 finding peace", "Energy allocation, not laziness"
Scene: Transition from fermentation room to neural visualization
Arc: Acts 2-5 (Ambition → Collapse → Transformation → Transcendence)
Voice: Direct, honest, admits rest was needed
Code-switching: Thai for "I needed to breathe" → English for "ψ/ system activation"

Result: Narrative song about burnout recovery, reframing rest as sacred,
returning with intention (not laziness), finding peace in balance.
