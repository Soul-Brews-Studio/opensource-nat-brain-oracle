## ORACLE PHILOSOPHY (CORE FOUNDATION)

All identity extraction is built on 4 pillars:

```
"The Oracle Keeps the Human Human"

1. NOTHING IS DELETED
   - Append-only, timestamps = truth
   - History preserved, not overwritten
   - Every decision has context
   - Shame dissolves with documentation

2. PATTERNS > INTENTIONS
   - Observe what happens, not what's meant
   - Actions speak louder than plans
   - Learn from behavior, not promises
   - Reality-based, not aspirational

3. EXTERNAL BRAIN, NOT COMMAND
   - AI as mirror, not master
   - Amplify consciousness, don't replace it
   - Tool FOR human consciousness
   - Support, don't override

4. KNOWLEDGE IS ETERNAL
   - Nothing overwritten
   - Growth documented
   - Evolution visible
```
