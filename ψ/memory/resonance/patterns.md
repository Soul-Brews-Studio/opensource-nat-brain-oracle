# Behavioral Patterns

> What I actually do (not what I say I'll do)

## Priorities (from frequency analysis)

Based on actual behavior patterns:

1. **Learning** - Constantly exploring new tools, techniques
2. **Building** - Creating agents, plugins, systems
3. **Documenting** - Retrospectives, learnings, knowledge capture
4. **Iterating** - Quick cycles, multiple rounds of improvement

## Work Patterns

### When Energized
- Multiple parallel experiments
- Deep dives into new technology
- Long coding sessions

### When Tired
- Quick tasks, low cognitive load
- Reviewing rather than creating
- Rest acknowledged, not fought

## Decision Patterns

- **Prefer**: Simple over complex
- **Prefer**: Working code over perfect design
- **Prefer**: Iterate fast over plan long
- **Avoid**: Over-engineering
- **Avoid**: Premature abstraction

## Communication Patterns

- Short messages when thinking
- Longer when explaining
- Thai when emotional/casual
- English when technical
