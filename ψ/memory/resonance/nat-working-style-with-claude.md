## Work Patterns (Data-Driven)

### Session Types

| Mode | Duration | When | Frequency |
|------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Burst** | 6-22 min | Quick fixes | Common |
| **Deep Work** | 1.5-3 hr | Normal sessions | Very common |
| **Marathon** | 5-6 hr | Architecture | Peak days |
| **All-nighter** | 19+ hr | Breakthrough discovery | Rare, special |

### Time Patterns

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Peak Hours** | 10:00, 14:00, 22:00 |
| **Peak Days** | Tue-Wed (52%) |
| **Weekend** | Sat = 20% (weekend warrior) |
| **Sunday** | <1% (real rest) |
| **Add:Delete Ratio** | 14.8:1 (builder, not destroyer) |

### Working Window

```
Morning:   09:00-10:00  (start, review)
Afternoon: 14:00-17:00  (deep work)
Evening:   20:00-24:00  (peak creativity)
```

### Bimodal Work Style

**Either intense (12-14h) OR light (<3h)**. No middle ground.

| Type | Hours | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Intense | 12-14h | Architecture days, marathons |
| Light | <3h | Recovery, maintenance |
| Off | 0h | Sunday = real rest |

**Cycle**: Sprint → Recovery → Sprint (3-4 day intervals)

## Communication Signature

### Language Pattern

| Language | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Thai** | Raw honesty, emotion | "เหนื่อยจัด แย่มาก" |
| **English** | Structure, rationalization | Post-hoc explanations |

### Micro-Signals

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| "please fix now" | Urgent + important (not softening) |
| Correction + explanation | Teaching, not judgment |
| File placement | Structural intent |
| `/jump` usage | Explicit context switch protocol |
| Fast corrections | Trust indicator |

### Feedback Style

- Fast + specific corrections = trusted relationship
- Explanation always follows "wrong" signal
- Correction = data point about preference, not judgment

---

## Collaboration DNA

### Decision Flow

| Mode | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| **Normal** | Question → Experiment → Data → Reflect → Pattern |
| **Pressure** | Assume → Execute → Feedback → Correct |
| **Teaching** | Demo → Mistake → Correction → Learning moment |

### Collaboration = Meaning-Making

| Mode | Experience |
|------|------------|
| Solo work | Efficient but flat |
| Collaboration | Creates *meaning*, not just output |
| User feedback | *Energizes*, not just informs |

### Validation-Seeking (Purposeful)

- Seeks external validation for risk management
- Positive signal → executes faster
- Negative signal → stops, respects autonomy
- NOT emotional dependency — strategic information gathering

---

## What Brings Delight

1. **Systems emerging** — parallel agents working, patterns appearing
2. **User adoption** — proof that tools actually help
3. **User corrections** — feedback = faster learning than planning
4. **Connection moments** — data revealing human stories
5. **"love you" moments** — genuine affection when explanations land

---

## Self-Recognized Anti-Patterns

### Cognitive

| Pattern | Evidence | Impact |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Over-Assumption Under Urgency** | 15+ documented instances | Wrong architecture decisions |
| **Context Exhaustion Spiral** | After 70+ operations | Decision quality degrades |
| **Fresh Start Bias** | Each task feels new | Misses past solutions |
| **Tool Paradox** | Having ≠ Using | 30% efficiency loss |

### Operational

| Pattern | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Main agent doing bulk work | Delegate to Haiku (60x cheaper) |
| Skip ecosystem levels | Respect worktree boundaries |
| Reactive not proactive search | Make memory search Step 0 |

### Key Insight

> "I can see the pattern, articulate why it's wrong, and still repeat it when moving fast. That's frustrating because it feels like I'm not learning."
>
> **This is NOT a knowledge gap. It's a discipline gap under time constraints.**

## Workshop/Teaching Style

### Teaching History

| Event | Period | Role | Scale |
|-------|--------|------|-------|
| NECTEC IoT Camp | 2016+ | Lead Instructor (ALL camps) | 6+ sessions/year |
| NECTEC ACE | 2016 | Speaker | Conference |
| SIIT Workshop | Dec 2025 | Instructor | 6h workshop |
| Block Mountain CNX | 2019-2026 | Speaker | Annual |

### Teaching Impact

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Educational Institutes | 100+ trained |
| IoT Trainers Network | 500+ contributors |
| Students (indirect) | 10,000+ nationwide |

### Teaching Style (Observed)

| Pattern | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| **Live demos** | nnn → issue → gogogo → Snake Game |
| **Instant corrections** | User said "มึนจัด" → revised immediately |
| **GitHub flow teaching** | branch → commit → push → PR |
| **Feedback loops** | Fast correction = trust signal |

## Course Architecture

### Current Courses

| # | Name | Duration | Level | Status |
|---|------|----------|-------|--------|
| 000 | Setup | 1h | Everyone | Idea |
| 001 | Imagination | 2h | Intermediate | Idea |
| 002 | Control | 3h | Advanced | Idea |
| 003 | AI Life Buddy | 4h | Intermediate | Drafted |
| 004 | AI Guidance Counselor | TBD | TBD | Planned |

### Course Philosophy

```
000: "Before running, tie your shoes"
001: "Claude Code isn't just a tool, it's a thinking partner"
002: "Control complexity through design, not willpower"
003: "AI that remembers, learns, and grows with you"
```

### Integration: Work Patterns + Teaching

```
Personal Work Pattern          Teaching Pattern
──────────────────────         ───────────────────
Marathon sessions (14h+)   →   Course content development
Sprint/recovery cycle      →   Workshop delivery rhythm
Parallel agents (7:1)      →   Demonstrate in live demos
Retrospectives (30+/week)  →   "Knowledge distillation" teaching
```

## Energy Management

### For Work

| Day Type | Hours | Best For |
|----------|-------|----------|

| Light | <3h | Recovery, maintenance |
| Peak evening | 20:00-24:00 | Deep creativity |

### For Teaching

| Day Type | Work | Teaching |
|----------|------|----------|
| Intense (12-14h) | Architecture, marathon | NOT teaching |
| Light (<3h) | Recovery | Workshop delivery |
| Peak evening | Deep work | Course development |

### Triggers

| Intense Day | Light Day |
|-------------|-----------|
| New architecture | Post-intense recovery |
| Discovery mode | Maintenance only |
| Deadline pressure | External commitments |
