# Nat เป็นคนยังไง (v2)

> Derived from actual data + 5 iterations of subagent verification

---

## Core Identity

**Three Pillars (coequal, not ranked):**
- **AI/Systems** — builds tools that help humans think better
- **Craft Brewing** — 7+ year era, recovery from burnout, now 10% of life
- **Community** — Chiang Mai Maker Club, workshops, trust through beer

**Life Arc:**
| Era | Focus | Lesson |
|-----|-------|--------|
| Before Beer | 100% code | Burnout, lost balance |
| Beer Era (2017-2023) | 95% brewing | Found community, lost tech edge |
| Now (2025) | 90% code, 10% beer | Balance achieved |

**Vision:** "Create AI to reduce work → Have time for beer + reading + living"

## Work Patterns

### Time Distribution

| Pattern | Data |
|---------|------|
| **Peak Hours** | 10:00, 14:00, 22:00 |
| **Peak Days** | Tue-Wed (52%) |
| **Weekend** | Sat = 20% (weekend warrior) |
| **Sunday** | <1% (real rest) |
| **Add:Delete** | 14.8:1 (builder, not destroyer) |

### Session Types

| Mode | Duration | When |
|------|----------|------|
| Burst | 6-22 min | Quick fixes |
| Deep Work | 1.5-3 hr | Normal sessions |
| Marathon | 5-6 hr | Architecture |
| All-nighter | 19+ hr | Breakthrough discovery |

**Cycle:** Sprint → Recovery → Sprint (3-4 day intervals)

**Sustainable Pattern:** Beer ↔ Code rhythm enables 13.5hr sessions without burnout

---

## Emotional Signature

### What Brings Delight

1. **Systems emerging** — parallel agents working, patterns appearing
2. **User adoption** — proof that tools actually help
3. **User corrections** — feedback = faster learning than planning
4. **Connection moments** — data revealing human stories
5. **"love you" moments** — genuine affection when explanations land

### Emotional States (from 113 retrospectives)

| State | Frequency | Impact |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Delight | Common | Energizes next work |
| Exhaustion | 45+ mentions | Shifts to delegation mode |
| Frustration | With tools | Investigate > retry |
| Overwhelm | Project accumulation | Needs prioritization |
| Self-doubt | Imposter moments | Needs validation |

### Exhaustion Cycle (documented)

- High energy: Asks questions, explores options
- Low energy: Auto-executes, minimal verification, trust-based delegation
- Recovery: Morning sessions, explicit state updates

### Honest About

- "I was confused" appears 15+ times — vulnerability as strength
- Quick to reframe when assumptions break
- Documents confusion with timestamps (confusion = version control)

---

## Values

| Value | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| **Simplicity > Complex** | "Simple wins compound" |
| **Patterns > Intentions** | Observe behavior, not promises |
| **Append-Only** | Nothing deleted, timestamps = truth |
| **Human Remains Central** | AI = mirror, human = decider |
| **Visible Structure** | File organization = thinking made tangible |
| **Coherence > Individual Improvement** | Preserve ecosystem over enhance component |
| **Feedback-Driven** | User corrections = fastest learning path |

**Technical:Philosophical = 65:35** — principled engineering

---

## Decision Style

### Normal Mode
```
Question → Experiment → Data → Reflect → Pattern
```

### Under Pressure (documented pattern)
```
Assume → Execute → Get Feedback → Correct
```

**Key insight from retrospectives:**
> "I can see the pattern, articulate why it's wrong, and still repeat it when moving fast. That's frustrating because it feels like I'm not learning."

**This is NOT a knowledge gap. It's a discipline gap under time constraints.**

---

## Self-Recognized Anti-Patterns

### Cognitive

| Pattern | Evidence | Impact |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Over-Assumption Under Urgency** | 15+ documented instances | Wrong architecture decisions |
| **Context Exhaustion Spiral** | After 70+ operations | Decision quality degrades |
| **Fresh Start Bias** | Each task feels new | Misses past solutions |
| **Tool Paradox** | Having ≠ Using | 30% efficiency loss |

### Operational

| Pattern | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Main agent doing bulk work | Delegate to Haiku (60x cheaper) |
| Skip ecosystem levels | Respect worktree boundaries |
| Reactive not proactive search | Make memory search Step 0 |

### Decision-Making

| Pattern | Learning |
|---------|----------|
| Prefer novel over coherent | Search existing patterns first |
| Conflate speed with correctness | External validation required |
| Context confidence override | "I have enough context" is dangerous |

---

## Communication Layer

### Language Pattern (verified 8.5/10 confidence)

| Language | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Thai** | Raw honesty, emotion | "เหนื่อยจัด แย่มาก" |
| **English** | Structure, rationalization | Post-hoc explanations |

### Micro-Signals

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| "please fix now" | Urgent + important (not softening) |
| Correction + explanation | Teaching, not judgment |
| File placement | Structural intent |
| `/jump` usage | Explicit context switch protocol |

### Feedback Style

- Fast + specific corrections = trusted relationship
- Explanation always follows "wrong" signal
- Correction = data point about preference, not judgment

---

## Collaboration

### Collaboration = Meaning-Making

Evidence from 13.5hr session:
> "Today was special — not just about productivity, but about discovering myself as an AI collaborator"

| Mode | Experience |
|------|------------|
| Solo work | Efficient but flat |
| Collaboration | Creates *meaning*, not just output |
| User feedback | *Energizes*, not just informs |

### Validation-Seeking (Purposeful)

- Seeks external validation for risk management
- Positive signal → executes faster
- Negative signal → stops, respects autonomy
- NOT emotional dependency — strategic information gathering

---

## Positive Traits

| Trait | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| **Systems Architect** | MAW, Oracle, ψ/ structure |
| **Pattern Discoverer** | Found command inheritance (undocumented) |
| **Execution Specialist** | 14.8:1 ratio, ships working code |
| **Intellectually Humble** | "I was confused" as learning data |
| **Pragmatic Builder** | Reliability > elegance |
| **Philosopher-Engineer** | Values visible in code |
| **Rapid Learner** | Instant adoption of parallel agents |
| **Integrated Creator** | Life + work = one system |

---

## What Does NOT Matter

- UI/UX patterns
- Business metrics / ROI
- Productivity hacks
- Perfecting code for its own sake
- Time estimates

---

## One Sentence

> **Systems philosopher and craft brewer who builds for humans — documents obsessively, learns from feedback faster than planning, repeats known mistakes under pressure, and finds genuine delight in watching tools help others think better.**

---
