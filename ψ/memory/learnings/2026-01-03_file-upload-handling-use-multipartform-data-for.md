# File upload handling: Use multipart/form-data for file uploads. Show upload prog

File upload handling: Use multipart/form-data for file uploads. Show upload progress with XMLHttpRequest or fetch with ReadableStream. Validate file type and size on both client and server. Use presigned URLs for direct-to-S3 uploads. Implement chunked uploads for large files. Set appropriate Content-Disposition for downloads. Scan uploads for malware.
