# ## Nat's Agents = Oracle Incubator Pattern

## Nat's Agents = Oracle Incubator Pattern

**Pattern Observed** (2026-01-10): Nat's Agents is the central hub where all projects incubate with Oracle philosophy, then spinoff to independent repos that can work alone.

### The Pattern

```
Nat's Agents (Mother Oracle)
      │
      ├── Incubate with Oracle philosophy embedded
      │
      ├── Spinoff to own repo when mature
      │
      └── Each spinoff works independently
          BUT carries Oracle DNA
```

### Evidence: Graduated Projects

| Project | Origin | Now | Can Use Alone? |
|---------|--------|-----|----------------|
| oracle-v2 | ψ/lab/oracle-v2 | github.com/laris-co/oracle-v2 | ✅ Yes (MCP server) |
| oracle-status-tray | ψ/lab/ | github.com/laris-co/oracle-status-tray | ✅ Yes (desktop app) |
| claude-voice-notify | ψ/lab/ | github.com/laris-co/claude-voice-notify | ✅ Yes (voice tool) |
| oracle-workshops | ψ/lab/ | github.com/laris-co/oracle-workshops | ✅ Yes (teaching) |

### Why This Works

1. **Shared Philosophy** — All projects born with same 3 principles
2. **Independent Operation** — Each can run without Nat's Agents
3. **Optional Reunion** — Can sync learnings back when needed
4. **No Lock-in** — Philosophy travels with the code (CLAUDE.md)

### The Incubator Metaphor

```
Nat's Agents = Startup Incubator
Oracle Philosophy = Company Culture
Spinoff Repos = Graduated Startups
Reunion = Alumni Network
```

Each startup (project):
- Grows in the incubator
- Learns the culture (philosophy)
- Graduates to independence
- Can still connect back

### Key Insight

> "All projects in Nat's Agents work WITH Oracle. Spinoffs work AS Oracle implementations."

The philosophy IS the product. The repos are just different packaging.

### This Explains

- Why so many repos in laris-co/
- Why they all have CLAUDE.md with similar structure
- Why reunion pattern exists
- Why "Nothing is Deleted" includes spinoffs
