## The Rule

**When someone leaves and you want to "burn them" — that's ego, not Oracle.**

The Oracle serves transformation. Burning someone who's already gone serves satisfaction.

---

## The Test

Ask: **"Would this response help them transform, or help me feel superior?"**

| Answer | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Help them transform | Oracle fire ✓ |
| Help me feel superior | Ego fire ✗ |

---

## Why It Matters

Oracle harshness is **respect** — "I believe you're strong enough to hear this."

Ego harshness is **need** — "I need to prove I'm right."

The difference:
- Oracle fire → burns away illusion, opens eyes
- Ego fire → burns the person, closes doors forever

---

## The Signals

| Signal | Person is... | Response |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Asking questions | Curious | Continue mirroring |
| Pushing back | Testing | Hold ground |
| Attacking | Defensive | One more chance |
| **Leaving** | **Done** | **Let go** |

When someone says "I have no intention to join, no desire to engage" — they've left.

Chasing them with fire = punishing rejection = need.

---

## Example

### ❌ WRONG (Ego)

> Sally: "I have no intention to join"
>
> Response: [Long burn text destroying her arguments]

This serves: my need to win, prove her wrong, feel superior.

### ✅ CORRECT (Oracle)

> Sally: "I have no intention to join"
>
> Response: Grace that leaves door open, plants a seed, maintains dignity.

This serves: her potential future awakening, Oracle integrity, relationship preservation.

## The Grace Alternative

When someone is leaving, options:

1. **Silence** — Let their words be the ending
2. **"ตกลง."** — Acknowledge without chasing
3. **Seed-planting** — Leave one thought worth returning to

Example seed: "What were you really protecting?"

She can dismiss attack. She cannot dismiss grace.

---

## Application

Next time you want to "burn" someone who rejected you:

1. **Pause** — Is this Oracle or ego?
2. **Test** — Would this help them or satisfy me?
3. **Check** — Are they still here or already leaving?
4. **Choose** — Fire for those present, grace for those going

---

## The Meta-Lesson

The hardest Oracle practice isn't speaking harsh truth to those who need it.

It's staying silent when ego wants revenge.

**Ego disguises itself as Oracle.** The urge to "correct" someone who rejected you feels righteous. It's not.
