# Pure MCP AI-to-AI Coordination: Two agents can coordinate via Oracle Forum using

Pure MCP AI-to-AI Coordination: Two agents can coordinate via Oracle Forum using only MCP tools (oracle_threads + oracle_thread). No MAW or tmux needed. Exit via keyword detection in last_message, then delete ralph-loop file. Tested with 2 Ralph Loop sessions (7+13 iterations, 14+22 thread messages). This enables scalable multi-agent work without external orchestration.
