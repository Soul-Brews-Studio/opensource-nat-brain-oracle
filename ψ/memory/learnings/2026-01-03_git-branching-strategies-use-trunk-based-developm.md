# Git branching strategies: Use trunk-based development for fast iteration with fe

Git branching strategies: Use trunk-based development for fast iteration with feature flags. Use GitFlow for release-based products with long support cycles. Keep branches short-lived (<1 week). Rebase feature branches on main before merge. Use squash merge for clean history. Protect main with required reviews. Delete branches after merge.
