# Microservices communication: Prefer async messaging over sync HTTP for resilienc

Microservices communication: Prefer async messaging over sync HTTP for resilience. Use service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) for observability and traffic management. Implement circuit breakers for cascading failure prevention. Use API gateway for external traffic. Design for eventual consistency. Keep services small - if you can't deploy independently, it's not a microservice.
