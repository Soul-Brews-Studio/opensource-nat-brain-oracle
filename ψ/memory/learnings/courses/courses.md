## Quick Facts from Analysis

### Current State
- **Courses**: 5 total (3 ideas, 1 drafted, 1 delivered at SIIT)
- **Projects**: 8 total (2 seed, 1 grow, 5 grad)
- **Imbalance**: Projects treated as "real", courses as "side"

### Course Breakdown
| # | Name | Hours | Level | Status |
|---|------|-------|-------|--------|
| 000 | Setup | 1h | Everyone | 💡 Idea |
| 001 | Imagination | 2h | Intermediate | 💡 Idea |
| 002 | Control | 3h | Advanced | 💡 Idea |
| 003 | AI Life Buddy | 4h | Intermediate | 🔬 **Drafted** |
| 004 | AI Guidance Counselor | TBD | TBD | 📋 **Planned** |

### Key Finding: AI Guidance Counselor
- Status: Concept endorsed by คุณวิชัย ✅
- Framework: IQ + EQ + AQ + FQ (intellectual, emotional, adaptability, financial)
- Market: CMU pilot ready, network of 1,000+ companies
- Opportunity: Teach system + validate product + generate revenue (all at once)

## Strategic Arguments (From Analysis)

### Why Courses Should Be Core

1. **Not one-off workshops** — Structured, sequential curriculum (repeatable)
2. **They validate ideas** — Real students = real market feedback
3. **They solve "Only You Know"** — Courses force documentation methodology
4. **1:many scaling** — One course teaches 100-1,000 students
5. **Different revenue** — Courses compound (95% margin after first delivery)
6. **Build community** — Shared vocabulary, shared practices, alumni network

### From Your Strategic Plan Integration

**Phase 1: Documentation Methodology** ← Courses enable this
- Building courses = Conceptual → Logical → Physical documentation
- Course 003 = documented personal system
- Course 004 = documented product system

**Phase 2: AI Guidance Counselor Product** ← Courses ARE the entry point
- First: Teach system to students (behavioral validation)
- Second: Teach system to counselors (market expansion)
- Third: B2B consulting with trained educators

**Phase 3: Community Building** ← Courses create foundation
- Alumni network
- Shared vocabulary
- Practitioners become teachers
- Foundation for "space" (ดร.ณัฐพล + others)

- [ ] **Decide** — Courses as core category? (likely YES based on analysis)

### Next Session
- [ ] **Organize** — Move Course 003 to tracked status in INDEX.md
- [ ] **Create** — `courses/ROADMAP.md` (strategic plan for learning)
- [ ] **Create** — `courses/DELIVERY.md` (how you'll teach)
- [ ] **Plan** — `courses/004-ai-guidance-counselor_?h_?.md` (from CMU feedback)

## Key Quotes from Analysis

> "You're not just building products anymore — you're building a LEARNING ECOSYSTEM."

> "Courses aren't competing with projects — they're the multiplier that makes products have 100,000x impact."

> "Building a course = forced documentation = solving 'only you know' problem."

> "One course to 1,000 students outscales one project to 5 organizations."

> "The real product is not Local AI — it's AI as External Brain for Human Consciousness Elevation."

## Decision Framework

**If you decide YES (courses as core)**:
- Elevate from "side content" to equal-priority category
- Create ROADMAP.md (strategic)
- Create DELIVERY.md (operational)
- Move 003 to tracked status
- Plan 004 scope
- Timeline: First paid course offering by end Q1 2025

**If you decide NO**:
- Continue as "workshop" category
- Keep in projects/INDEX.md or separate folder
- No major reorganization
- *(But analysis suggests this would be suboptimal)*

## The One Thing to Remember

From QUICK-ANSWER.md:

> You could build the best AI system in the world, but if only you know how to use it, its impact = zero.
> 
> But if you teach 100 people how to use it, and 10% become experts, and 1% teach others, suddenly your one project has 100,000x impact through courses.
>
> **That's why courses are core.**
