# Learning Progression Framework (Bloom's + Practice)

Learning Progression Framework (Bloom's + Practice)

**Existing Course Architecture**:
- 3-level progression: 000 → 001 → 002 → 003
- Workshop, video, intensive formats
- Thai/English bilingual support

**Teaching Methodology (Proven)**:
| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Problem-first | Students bring real problems |
| 50/50 teaching/doing | Half lecture, half practice |
| Session → prototype → learning | Real output in 15 minutes |
| Independence goal | "Teach fishing, not give fish" |

**Implicit Learning Principles**:
- Scaffolding: Containers first, then content
- Mastery progression: Pattern → implementation → mastery
- Active + passive: Guided + autonomous learning
- Session as unit: 60-90 minute chunks

**What Psychology Education Adds**:
1. Bloom's Taxonomy (learn → understand → apply → analyze)
2. Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)
3. Behavioral objectives (observable outcomes)
4. Assessment loops (formative + summative)
5. Adaptation mechanisms (just-in-time support)
6. Psychological safety (safety before content)

**Total for first psychology course**: ~50-65 hours
