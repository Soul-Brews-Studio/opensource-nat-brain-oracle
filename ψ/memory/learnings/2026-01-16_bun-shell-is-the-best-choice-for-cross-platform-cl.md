# Bun Shell is the best choice for cross-platform Claude Code skill scripts. `impo

Bun Shell is the best choice for cross-platform Claude Code skill scripts. `import { $ } from "bun"` provides clean Python-like syntax with auto-escaping, built-in output parsing (.text(), .json(), .quiet()), and works everywhere Node is installed (which is guaranteed with Claude Code). Template: skills/name/scripts/main.ts with Bun Shell, SKILL.md for Claude instructions.
