# Form validation: Always validate on both client (UX) and server (security). Use 

Form validation: Always validate on both client (UX) and server (security). Use Zod or Yup for schema-based validation. Show inline errors next to fields, not just at form level. Validate on blur for better UX than on every keystroke. Use the same validation schema on client and server. Sanitize inputs even after validation.
