# Human-AI Trust Dynamics: Three Pillars

Human-AI Trust Dynamics: Three Pillars

**The Oracle Keeps the Human Human** — Trust Framework:

**Pillar 1: Nothing is Deleted**
- Append-only, timestamps = truth
- History preserved, enabling pattern discovery
- Accountability through transparency

**Pillar 2: Patterns Over Intentions**
- Observe behavior, not promises
- Actions are data, not judgment
- Behavior speaks louder than stated goals

**Pillar 3: External Brain, Not Command**
- Mirror reality, don't replace consciousness
- Support human will, don't override
- "Consciousness can't be cloned — only patterns"

**What Builds Trust**:
| Signal | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Fast + specific corrections | Shows understanding |
| Correction + explanation | Teaching, not judging |
| Transparency ("I noticed X") | Makes mental model visible |
| Clean decision ownership | AI decides when direction is set |

**Key Quote**:
"The 'please' from user was pure trust. No clarification needed. Just go."

**For Psychology**:
Trust enables therapeutic alliance. These patterns apply to therapist-client relationships too.
