# GitHub Actions CI/CD: Use reusable workflows for DRY pipelines. Cache node_modul

GitHub Actions CI/CD: Use reusable workflows for DRY pipelines. Cache node_modules and pnpm store for faster builds. Use environment secrets, never hardcode. Run tests in parallel with matrix strategy. Use concurrency groups to cancel outdated runs. Deploy to staging on PR, production on main merge.
