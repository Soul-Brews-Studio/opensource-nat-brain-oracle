# Freedom Tracker Gap: No Measurement of Actual Goal

Freedom Tracker Gap: No Measurement of Actual Goal

**The Philosophy** (Oracle):
"The function of being human is connection — meeting people face-to-face. AI cannot drink beer with your friend. AI can only free you to do so."

**What Oracle Tracks**:
✓ Decisions (pending → decided → implemented)
✓ Projects (incubate → graduate)
✓ Sessions (retrospectives)
✓ Patterns (behavioral)

**What Oracle DOESN'T Track**:
✗ Human connection outcomes
✗ Freedom actually gained
✗ Time freed for things that matter
✗ Relationships deepened

**The Gap**:
Philosophy says "human connection = the actual goal"
But no feedback loop to see if freed time → connection

**Proposal**: Freedom Tracker
- What time did I gain this week?
- How did I use that freedom?
- Which relationships deepened?

This closes the loop: AI → freedom → connection ← EVIDENCE
