# Web Workers for heavy computation: Offload CPU-intensive tasks to prevent UI blo

Web Workers for heavy computation: Offload CPU-intensive tasks to prevent UI blocking. Workers run in separate thread, communicate via postMessage. Use for parsing, encryption, image processing. Transferable objects for efficient data passing. Consider Comlink for cleaner API. SharedArrayBuffer for shared memory (requires specific headers). Pool workers for frequent tasks.
