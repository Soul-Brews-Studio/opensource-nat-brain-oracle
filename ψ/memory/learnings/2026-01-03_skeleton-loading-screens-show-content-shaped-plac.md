# Skeleton loading screens: Show content-shaped placeholders during load. Match sk

Skeleton loading screens: Show content-shaped placeholders during load. Match skeleton layout to actual content structure. Use subtle shimmer animation for perceived progress. Skeleton is better than spinners for content-heavy pages. Load critical content first, skeleton for secondary. Avoid skeleton flash for fast loads - use delay threshold.
