# API versioning strategy: Use URL path versioning (/v1/, /v2/) for major breaking

API versioning strategy: Use URL path versioning (/v1/, /v2/) for major breaking changes. Use header versioning for minor variations. Support N-1 versions minimum (current and previous). Deprecate with warnings before removal. Document migration paths. Consider GraphQL's schema evolution over versioning.
