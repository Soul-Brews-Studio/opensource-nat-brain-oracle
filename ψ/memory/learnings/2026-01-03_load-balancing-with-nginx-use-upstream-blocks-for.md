# Load balancing with Nginx: Use upstream blocks for backend pools. Implement heal

Load balancing with Nginx: Use upstream blocks for backend pools. Implement health checks to remove failing servers. Use least_conn for uneven request processing times, round-robin for uniform loads. Enable keepalive connections to backends. Configure proper timeouts. Use X-Forwarded-For to preserve client IPs. Cache static assets at the proxy level.
