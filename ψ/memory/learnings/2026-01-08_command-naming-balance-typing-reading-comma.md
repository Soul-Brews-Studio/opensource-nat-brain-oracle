# ## Command Naming: Balance Typing + Reading

## Command Naming: Balance Typing + Reading

Commands need TWO ergonomics:
1. **Easy to type** - low friction for input
2. **Easy to scan** - readable at a glance

**Anti-patterns:**
- `/ps` - fast to type, hard to read/remember
- `/project-manager-search-repositories` - clear but painful

**Good balance:**
- `/project search` - readable, reasonable length
- `rrr` - short codes OK for FREQUENT actions (muscle memory)
- Full words for OCCASIONAL actions (need to remember)

**Rule of thumb:**
- Frequent (10x/day): short codes OK (`rrr`, `ccc`)
- Occasional: readable words (`/project search`)

Eye-brain scanning > keystroke count for infrequent commands.
