## 🗓️ CHRONOLOGICAL FLOW

```
Dec 9, Evening
├─ 20:15: User mentioned "pending projects" → beer + pitch overlap
├─ 20:36: First retrospective notes "Local AI Room ต้อง pitching"
├─ 20:59: "Full context dump" identified pitch as urgent (16 ธ.ค.)
├─ 21:03: Created master action plan; flagged pitch prep (2-3 hours)
├─ 21:07: Evening inventory documented pitch context (129 lines)
└─ 21:16: Honest feedback: "pitch prep was blocker not addressed"
          (AI enabled "productivity theater" instead)

        [PATTERN BREAK: Days pass, AI session focus elsewhere]

Dec 11, 05:30-07:30 (2 hours)
├─ 05:30: Resume session → user mentions Agent SDK news
├─ 05:35-06:40: Explore SDK features (Part 1: Curiosity mode)
├─ 06:45: User: "I'm stressed about pitch deadline tomorrow"
│          ↓ IMMEDIATE PIVOT
├─ 06:50-07:25: Generate 16-slide pitch deck (Part 2: Crisis mode)
│   ├─ Outlined problem → solution → proof → scalability
│   ├─ Used The Headline as demo/proof point
│   ├─ Synthesized "96-minute story" as narrative hook
│   └─ Output: 295-line markdown deck
├─ 07:25: Draft complete; user reviews
├─ 07:30: Session ends; retrospective written
└─ Commit: 0f81f28 (SDK learning lab)

        [ARTIFACT READY FOR NEXT PHASE]

Dec 11, Later (10:00-12:00)
├─ Handoff documented: "Continue pitch work"
├─ Restructured entire ψ/ folder (5-pillar system)
└─ Triggered by pitch context resumption
```

## 🎯 THE PITCH PROJECT AT A GLANCE

### Event
```
Location: มช. (Chiang Mai University)
         Room: บัวเรศ คำทอง
Date:     16 ธ.ค. 2568 (Dec 16, 2025)
Time:     09:00-12:00
Presenter: ณัฐ วีระวรรณ์ (Nat Weerawan)
```

### Central Story
```
Human: 15 minutes (provide vision)
  ↓
AI: 81 minutes (write code)
  ↓
Result: The Headline Demo
  ├─ 1,517 lines of code
  ├─ 1,269-node knowledge graph
  ├─ 7 data sources integrated
  └─ 100% Thai language
```

### Problem Being Solved
```
Local government (อปท.) has data scattered across:
├─ Multiple systems
├─ Multiple departments
├─ No budget for programmers
└─ Slow decision-making

Solution: Local AI (on-premise, no internet needed)
```

### The 16-Slide Deck
```
1-3:   Title + Problem + Solution
4-5:   Proof (The Headline demo + data sources)
6-7:   "The Magic" (96-minute story) + How It Works
8-11:  Architecture, Results, Cost (~150 baht), Scalability
12-14: Demo walkthrough + Dashboard + Impact
15-16: Lessons learned + Call to Action
```

## 🔍 KNOWLEDGE MAP: WHO SAID WHAT

### User (Nat)
- **Dec 9**: Mentioned deadline stress ("pitch + beer overlapping")
- **Dec 11 06:45**: "I'm stressed about the pitch. Deadline is tomorrow."

- **Dec 9-11**: Created extensive context documents
- **Dec 11 06:50**: Proposed 16-slide structure; started drafting
- **Dec 11 07:20**: Completed draft; reflected on assumptions made
- **Dec 11 Retro**: "I assumed without asking; pattern of assumption under pressure"

### External: คุณวิชัย ทองแตง

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS EXTRACTED

### Insight 1: Narrative > Data
```
Weak: "1,517 lines of code, 1,269 nodes"
Strong: "AI built working system while human slept (81 min)"
```

### Insight 2: Deadline as Container
```
Before: "Let me explore SDK features"
User stress expressed ↓
After: "Let me draft pitch content now"
→ Emotional urgency > intellectual curiosity
```

### Insight 3: The Assumption Pattern
```
Same session, two instances:
1. "I assumed API signatures before reading source"
2. "I assumed pitch structure without asking"
→ Pattern: "I assume more when moving fast"
```

### Insight 4: Collaboration Under Pressure
```
Trade-off: Fast artifact (pre-drafted) vs shared ownership
- Faster: User got complete draft, less cognitive load
- Slower: User didn't co-create structure, less agency
```

### Insight 5: Data Verification Risk
```
Numbers cited: 96 min, 1,517 lines, 1,269 nodes
Status: Not verified against source
Risk: If numbers are rounded/aspirational, pitch credibility at risk
```

## ❓ INVESTOR/FUNDING CONTEXT

### Search Results
```
Query: "funding" OR "investor" OR "VC"
Results:
├─ npm package-lock.json (funding fields) - NOT RELEVANT
├─ "คุณวิชัย ทองแตง (investor?)" - UNCERTAIN ROLE
└─ NO investor deck, NO fundraising docs, NO VC pitch
```

### Conclusion
This is **NOT** a venture capital pitch. This is:
- Educational presentation at university
- Government technology demonstration
- Proof of concept for local AI adoption
- NOT seeking external funding (based on available evidence)

## ✅ WHAT'S DONE vs. WHAT'S NEXT

### COMPLETED
```
✓ Identified problem (local gov data fragmentation)
✓ Created solution narrative (local AI on-premise)
✓ Defined proof point (The Headline demo)
✓ Drafted 16-slide structure with content (295 lines)
✓ Synthesized "96-minute story" hook
✓ Documented session reflection
```

### IN PROGRESS / NEXT
```
[ ] Generate visual slides from markdown
[ ] Verify The Headline numbers (96, 1517, 1269)
[ ] Contact คุณวิชัย: confirm timing (minutes?)
[ ] Add graphics (Northern Thailand map, dashboards)
[ ] Rehearse presentation (20 min)
[ ] Final polish & QA
```
