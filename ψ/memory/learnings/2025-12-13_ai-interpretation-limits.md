# AI Interpretation Limits

**Date**: 2025-12-13

## What We Learned

- AI fills gaps with assumptions when context is incomplete
- "คนนี้เหงา พูดไม่หยุด 2 ชม." → AI assumed Claude chat, was actually friend ชิน
- Screenshots, images, referenced content = invisible to AI
- User correction is valuable — Oracle records the truth, not the guess

## Pattern

```
Partial data → AI fills gap → Wrong interpretation → User corrects → Learning
```

**Prevention**: Ask "screenshot of what?" instead of assuming

## How Things Connect

- `/random` command interprets content — must acknowledge limits
- Oracle philosophy: "Patterns Over Intentions" — observe what IS, not what seems
- Dual links pattern: ask clarifying questions first (wikilinks only? both?)
