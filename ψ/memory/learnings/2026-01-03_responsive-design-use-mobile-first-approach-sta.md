# Responsive design: Use mobile-first approach - start with smallest screens. Defi

Responsive design: Use mobile-first approach - start with smallest screens. Define breakpoints based on content, not devices. Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts. Use relative units (rem, %, vw) over pixels. Test on real devices, not just browser resize. Use container queries for component-level responsiveness. Optimize touch targets (min 44px).
