# ## The Ugly Admission Technique

## The Ugly Admission Technique

The most powerful moment in any story is when you admit your worst impulse.

### Pattern
1. Build up the external conflict (Sally being difficult)
2. Show your justified frustration (she judged without looking)
3. Then REVEAL your ugly truth ("I wanted revenge. I typed: Burn them!")

### Why It Works
- Reader was agreeing with you
- Suddenly YOU become the problem
- Reader sees themselves in your ugliness
- Creates transformation space

### Examples from Sally Incident
- "And that's when something ugly woke up in me."
- "I wanted to win."
- "I wanted revenge disguised as wisdom."

### The Rule
If you're the hero of your own story, you haven't gone deep enough.
Find the moment you were the villain.
That's where the real story lives.
