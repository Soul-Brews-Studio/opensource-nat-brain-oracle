# ## Speckit Slash Command Flow Works Smoothly

## Speckit Slash Command Flow Works Smoothly

**Observation**: When practicing `/speckit.specify` with a simple hello-greeting feature, the entire flow went smoothly:

1. Called `/speckit.specify Add a simple hello world greeting feature...`
2. Script auto-generated branch `053-hello-greeting` and spec structure
3. Filled in spec.md with User Stories, Requirements, Success Criteria
4. Created quality checklist - all items passed
5. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] needed for simple features

**Key Success Factors**:
- Let the script handle branch numbering (found highest: 052 → created 053)
- Follow template structure exactly
- Focus on WHAT not HOW (no implementation details in spec)
- Simple features need fewer clarifications

**Confidence Boost**: The speckit workflow is intuitive when you trust the commands and let them guide you. No fear about getting it wrong - just follow the flow.
