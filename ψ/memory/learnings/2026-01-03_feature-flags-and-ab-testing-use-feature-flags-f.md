# Feature flags and A/B testing: Use feature flags for gradual rollouts (1% → 10% 

Feature flags and A/B testing: Use feature flags for gradual rollouts (1% → 10% → 50% → 100%). Separate deployment from release. Store flag state externally (LaunchDarkly, Unleash, or Redis). Clean up old flags regularly - they become tech debt. Use percentage-based or user-segment targeting for A/B tests.
