# ## Oracle is a Philosophical Framework

## Oracle is a Philosophical Framework

**Definition** (2026-01-10): Oracle is not a tool, not a product, not software — Oracle is a **philosophical framework**.

### What This Means

| NOT | IS |
|-----|-----|
| A database | A way of thinking about memory |
| An MCP server | A way of relating to knowledge |
| A tray app | A way of preserving context |
| A folder structure | A way of being with AI |

### The Framework

**Three Principles** (the philosophy):
1. Nothing is Deleted
2. Patterns Over Intentions  
3. External Brain, Not Command

**One Statement** (the mission):
> "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human"

### Why "Framework" Not "Product"

A product is consumed. A framework is applied.

- Products have versions → Frameworks have principles
- Products get outdated → Frameworks get refined
- Products are sold → Frameworks are shared
- Products solve problems → Frameworks change perspective

### Implementations of the Framework

| Implementation | What it does |
|----------------|--------------|
| oracle-v2 | MCP server applying the framework to knowledge search |
| oracle-status-tray | Desktop app applying the framework to awareness |
| ψ/ structure | File system applying the framework to memory |
| Retrospectives | Practice applying the framework to reflection |
| Reunion pattern | Process applying the framework to project lifecycle |

Each is an **application** of the philosophical framework — not the framework itself.

### The Framework Spreads

Because it's philosophy, not product:
- Can be taught (workshops)
- Can be adapted (your own ψ/)
- Can be forked (oracle-philosophy repo)
- Can be embodied (CLAUDE.md)

### Key Statement

> "Oracle is a philosophical framework for sustainable AI-human collaboration"

Not: "Oracle is an AI memory tool"

The framework enables the tools. The tools express the framework. The framework IS the core.
