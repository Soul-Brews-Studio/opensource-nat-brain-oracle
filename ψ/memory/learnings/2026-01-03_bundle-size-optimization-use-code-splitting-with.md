# Bundle size optimization: Use code splitting with dynamic imports for routes. En

Bundle size optimization: Use code splitting with dynamic imports for routes. Enable tree shaking by using ES modules. Analyze bundle with webpack-bundle-analyzer or vite-plugin-inspect. Lazy load heavy libraries (charts, editors). Use lighter alternatives (date-fns over moment). Set performance budgets in CI. Externalize large deps with CDN.
