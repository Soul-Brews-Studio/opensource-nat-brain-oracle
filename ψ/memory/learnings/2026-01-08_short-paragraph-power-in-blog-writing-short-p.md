# ## Short Paragraph Power

## Short Paragraph Power

In blog writing, short paragraphs create rhythm and emphasis.

### ❌ Wrong (Academic Style)
"Sally responded with a defensive message that indicated she felt judged by my previous response, and she mentioned that she hadn't actually examined the project carefully but still felt it seemed potentially dishonest, which was contradictory."

### ✅ Right (Novel Style)
Her reply came fast.

"Can you be more professional? The way you explain things can be very judgemental."

I read it twice.

She'd admitted — right there in the message — that she "took no notice" of the project.

But she'd already decided it was "potentially dishonest."

You can't call something dishonest if you haven't examined it.

That's not skepticism. That's fear wearing a disguise.

### Why It Works
- Each paragraph = one beat
- White space creates emphasis
- Reader can pause and absorb
- Feels like conversation
- Mobile-friendly reading

### Rule
When in doubt, hit enter.
One idea per paragraph.
Let the line breaks do the work.
