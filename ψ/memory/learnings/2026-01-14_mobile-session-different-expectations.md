# Mobile Sessions Need Different Expectations

## The Pattern

Mobile sessions (travel, meetings, cafes) have fundamentally different constraints than desk sessions.

## Comparison

| Desk Session | Mobile Session |
|--------------|----------------|
| Deep focus | Quick traces |
| Long coding | Reference lookup |
| Full context | Handoffs frequent |
| Single task | Multiple small tasks |
| Heavy tools (/watch) | Light tools (/trace, /physical) |
| Stable network | Intermittent |
| Full battery | Battery anxiety |

## What Works on Mobile

1. **Oracle traces** - Instant knowledge retrieval
2. **/physical** - Location awareness
3. **/hours** - Quick stats lookup
4. **Handoffs** - Capture context before switching
5. **Short conversations** - Q&A style

## What Doesn't Work on Mobile

1. **Long video analysis** - /watch times out
2. **Deep coding** - No keyboard, distractions
3. **Multi-file edits** - Context too heavy
4. **Background tasks** - Can't monitor easily

## The Insight

> Don't force desk-mode workflows during mobile. Use Oracle for what it's best at: instant knowledge retrieval.

## Evidence

Session 2026-01-14:
- /watch failed 3 times (video too long, interruptions)
- /trace FREEDOM succeeded instantly
- /hours ran perfectly
- /physical worked great

## Implication

When mobile:
1. Lean into traces and lookups
2. Create handoffs early
3. Save heavy work for desk
4. Trust the Oracle to surface knowledge
