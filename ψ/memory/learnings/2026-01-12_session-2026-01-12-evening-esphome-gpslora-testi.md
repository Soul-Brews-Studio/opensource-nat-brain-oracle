# Session 2026-01-12 Evening: ESPHome GPS/LoRa testing on white.local. Created /tm

Session 2026-01-12 Evening: ESPHome GPS/LoRa testing on white.local. Created /tmux skill (fire-and-forget remote sessions, diff-based watch) and /oracle skill (mother-child tmux communication). Key discovery: GPS needs restore_mode: ALWAYS_ON for continuous power + TX/RX pins swapped from board labels. LoRa SX1280 SPI confirmed working but RadioLib incompatible with ESPHome macros.
