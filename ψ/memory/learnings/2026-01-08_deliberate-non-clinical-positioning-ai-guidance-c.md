# Deliberate Non-Clinical Positioning (AI Guidance Counselor)

Deliberate Non-Clinical Positioning (AI Guidance Counselor)

**The Boundary**:
AI positioned as "personal insight system" NOT therapy — this is INTENTIONAL.

**What Course 004 (AI Guidance Counselor) Offers**:
- IQ + EQ + AQ + FQ assessment
- Career path guidance
- Self-knowledge discovery
- Strengths identification

**What It Does NOT Offer**:
- Clinical diagnosis (DSM-5, ICD-11)
- Therapeutic treatment
- Crisis intervention
- Mental health treatment

**Market Context**:
- Thailand: 1 counselor per 5,000 students (severe shortage)
- Target: 1,000+ companies, school counselors
- Strategy: Students first → Teachers/counselors next

**Why Non-Clinical**:
1. Avoids liability without licensed professionals
2. Respects therapeutic alliance boundaries
3. Can still provide massive value in insight/guidance
4. Clear scope prevents harm from overreach

**For Psychology Curriculum**:
Position AI tools as SUPPORT for counselors, not REPLACEMENT.
