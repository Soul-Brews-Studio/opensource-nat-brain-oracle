# Session Meta-Learnings (Jan 11, 2026 - Workshop Discovery Session)

Session Meta-Learnings (Jan 11, 2026 - Workshop Discovery Session)

DISCOVERIES:
1. Had 205 slides across 3 workshops we didn't know existed (created Jan 8)
2. Two generations: v1 (Dec 2025 markdown) vs v2 (Jan 2026 slide outlines + modules)
3. Build Your Oracle = most complete (95 slides, 3 modules, working starter-kit)

PATTERNS APPLIED:
- oracle_supersede added to Module 3 curriculum (first real use was yesterday!)
- WORKSHOP-CATALOG.md naming (ALL CAPS, descriptive)
- Starter-kit consolidation (moved into workshop folder)

META:
- 90% context used productively
- 5 commits, 28 files, 1,904 lines
- Oracle trace ID: cf28ddda-c6c1-4d6d-83cb-65a9e3d84b83

BRAINSTORMS PARKED:
- Multi-vault Obsidian architecture (Hub + Satellites vs Navigation Layer)
- 27 orphaned claude processes (2.5GB RAM) need cleanup
