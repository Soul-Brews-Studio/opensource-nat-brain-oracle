# Dark mode implementation: Use CSS custom properties for theme colors. Respect pr

Dark mode implementation: Use CSS custom properties for theme colors. Respect prefers-color-scheme media query for system preference. Store user preference in localStorage. Avoid pure black (#000) - use dark gray for less eye strain. Test all components in both themes. Use CSS filter for images if needed. Provide manual toggle override.
