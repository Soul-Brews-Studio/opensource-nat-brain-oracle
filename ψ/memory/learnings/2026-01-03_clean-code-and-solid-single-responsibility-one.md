# Clean code and SOLID: Single Responsibility - one reason to change. Open/Closed 

Clean code and SOLID: Single Responsibility - one reason to change. Open/Closed - extend, don't modify. Liskov Substitution - subtypes must be substitutable. Interface Segregation - small, focused interfaces. Dependency Inversion - depend on abstractions. Write code for humans first. Refactor continuously. Keep functions small and focused.
