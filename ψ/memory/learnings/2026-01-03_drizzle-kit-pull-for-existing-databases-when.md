**drizzle-kit pull for existing databases**

When migrating an existing SQLite database to Drizzle ORM, use `drizzle-kit pull` to introspect and auto-generate the schema. It detects tables, columns, indexes, and constraints automatically. Much faster than rewriting schema by hand, and ensures the generated types match reality.
