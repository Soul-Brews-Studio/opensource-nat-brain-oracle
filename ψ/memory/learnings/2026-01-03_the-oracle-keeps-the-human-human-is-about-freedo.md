# "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human" is about FREEDOM, not money. Money is just on

"The Oracle Keeps the Human Human" is about FREEDOM, not money. Money is just one example of unfreedom. The core philosophy: Humans are trapped by unfinished tasks, obligations, things they don't want to do. AI removes obstacles → freedom returns → can do what you love → can meet people → physical connection → human becomes more human. The function of being human is CONNECTION. AI cannot drink beer with your friend. AI can only free you to do so.
