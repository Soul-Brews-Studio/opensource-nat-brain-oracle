# AI Psychology Application Framework

AI Psychology Application Framework

**Pattern**: AI as psychological tool requires explicit boundaries

**What Oracle Knows**:
- AI as mirror (self-reflection externalized)
- Fear of AI = fear of self
- Freedom chain: AI removes obstacles → human connection

**What Oracle Lacks for Psychology**:
1. No clinical/diagnostic framework (DSM-5, ICD-11)
2. No therapeutic modalities (CBT, DBT, ACT)
3. No safety/crisis protocols
4. No validated psychometric instruments

**Recommendation**:
- Position as "personal insight system" NOT therapy
- "Self-knowledge + strengths discovery" framing
- Refer to licensed professionals for clinical needs

**For Psychology Curriculum** (e.g., อจ. ชินัณ):
- AI as metacognition tool
- Pattern recognition without diagnosis
- Emotional awareness without treatment
