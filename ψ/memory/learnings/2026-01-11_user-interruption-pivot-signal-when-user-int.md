# ## User Interruption = Pivot Signal

## User Interruption = Pivot Signal

When user interrupts mid-response or mid-implementation:
- This is NOT rudeness
- This IS strong signal current approach isn't landing

**Response pattern**:
1. Stop immediately
2. Don't defend or explain current approach
3. Listen for what they actually want
4. Pivot without ego

Session example:
- Me: Adding subtle 0.4 opacity...
- User: [interrupts] "still dark!"
- Correct response: Jump to white 0.9, not justify why 0.4 should work

Interruptions during creative iteration = "wrong direction, turn now"
