# Preventing infinite loops: Always have a base case in recursion. Use iteration l

Preventing infinite loops: Always have a base case in recursion. Use iteration limits as safeguard. Watch for circular references in data structures. Use WeakMap/WeakSet to track visited objects. In React, check useEffect dependencies carefully. Add timeout/circuit breaker for external calls. Log loop iterations in development for debugging.
