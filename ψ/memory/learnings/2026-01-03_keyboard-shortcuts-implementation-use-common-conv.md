# Keyboard shortcuts implementation: Use common conventions (Cmd/Ctrl+S save, Esc 

Keyboard shortcuts implementation: Use common conventions (Cmd/Ctrl+S save, Esc close). Don't override browser defaults. Show shortcuts in tooltips and menus. Use useHotkeys or similar library for React. Handle modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) consistently. Provide shortcut cheatsheet (? key). Ensure all features are keyboard accessible.
