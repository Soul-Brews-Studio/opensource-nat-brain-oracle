# 3Blue1Brown Neural Networks Ch.1 Summary:

3Blue1Brown Neural Networks Ch.1 Summary:

**Core concept**: Neural network = complex math function with tunable parameters (weights/biases)

**Structure**: Input Layer (784 pixels) → Hidden Layers (detect edges/patterns) → Output Layer (10 digits)

**Key math**: Weighted sum + bias → Activation function (Sigmoid/ReLU) → Next layer

**Learning** = finding optimal weight/bias values through training

**Timestamps**: 00:00 intro, 02:43 neurons, 05:49 layers, 08:21 weights, 10:24 sigmoid, 13:26 matrix notation, 15:18 network-as-function, 17:03 ReLU
