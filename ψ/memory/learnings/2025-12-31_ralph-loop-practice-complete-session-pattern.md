# **Ralph Loop Practice - Complete Session Pattern**

**Ralph Loop Practice - Complete Session Pattern**

9 iterations practicing new MCP-assisted workflow. Key outcomes:

**Apps Created**:
- 057-session-timer: start/stop/status/history (10 min)
- 058-quick-note: jot/list/search with FTS5 (5 min)
- 059-focus-log: focus/what/done (3 min)

**Pattern Acceleration**: Each app 2x faster. By third app, implementation is muscle memory.

**Workflow That Works**:
1. `/speckit.specify` - Creates branch + spec
2. Constitution check passes
3. Plan with tech decisions
4. Implement using proven stack (Bun + Drizzle + Commander)
5. Test → Commit → Learn

**MCP Tools Used Naturally**:
- oracle_search: Find patterns
- oracle_learn: Capture insights immediately
- Handoffs: Preserve session context

**Key Realization**: Tools should feel like extensions of thinking, not interruptions. When the workflow is smooth, you don't notice the tools - you just work.
