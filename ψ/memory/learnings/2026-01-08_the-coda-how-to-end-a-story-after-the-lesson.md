## The Coda: How to End a Story

After the lesson is learned, add a quiet moment of reflection.

### Pattern
1. Time has passed ("It's evening now")
2. Physical detail ("The coffee shop is closing")
3. Return to the person/event with new eyes
4. Unanswered questions (wonder, not conclude)
5. Acceptance of not knowing
6. Universal principle

### Example from Sally Incident
"It's evening now. The coffee shop is closing. The sun has moved across the floor and disappeared.

I'm thinking about Sally. Not with anger anymore. Just... wondering.

What WAS she protecting?
What made a simple invitation feel like an attack?
What would have happened if she'd asked a question instead of offering money?

I'll never know. And that's okay."

### Why It Works
- Shows transformation (angry → wondering)
- Humanizes the "opponent"
- Leaves space for reader reflection
- Doesn't over-conclude
- Peaceful, not triumphant

### The Rule
Don't end with victory. End with peace.
Don't end with answers. End with questions.
The reader should exhale, not applaud.
