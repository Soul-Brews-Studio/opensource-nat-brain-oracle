# Burnout Prevention: Bimodal Work + Recovery Cycle

Burnout Prevention: Bimodal Work + Recovery Cycle

**The Pattern**:
- Bimodal work: Either intense (12-14h) OR light (<3h)
- No middle ground
- Sprint → Recovery → Sprint (3-4 day cycles)
- Sunday = <1% usage = "real rest" (protected)

**Burnout Indicators Documented**:
- 19-hour overnight session → exhaustion
- Thai language: "เหนื่อยจัด แย่มาก"
- Recovery attempts: Thai massage, acupuncture

**Critical Gaps for Psychology**:
| Gap | Needed |
|-----|--------|
| No burnout metrics | Fatigue score 1-10, recovery debt |
| No correlation engine | Mood ↔ session intensity |
| No recovery tracking | Massage, sleep, naps effectiveness |
| No intervention logic | "You need rest" alerts |
| No sleep tracking | Sleep hours, Sunday protection |

**Recommended Architecture**:
1. Mood logging (EXISTS: mood-log lab)
2. Recovery tracking (TODO)
3. Work session integration (TODO)
4. Burnout risk model (TODO)
5. Intervention suggestions (TODO)

**Key Insight**:
"Sunday is <1% usage. Keep it protected."
