# # Exploratory Jump Pattern - Context Building Before Action

# Exploratory Jump Pattern - Context Building Before Action

**Date**: 2026-01-11
**Session**: Private class (Nat-s-Agents)

## The Pattern

When facing a significant decision or new creation (like Arthur Birth), the session becomes a series of exploratory jumps that appear scattered but are actually **systematic context building**:

1. Trace the origin (`/trace oracle-v2 port`)
2. Understand the architecture (backend, Hono.js, FTS5)
3. Explore related concepts (Three.js for visualization)
4. Discover the naming pattern (Arthur = first named child Oracle)
5. Research extensibility (skill creation docs)

Each "jump" adds a layer to the mental model.

## Why It Works

Before birthing something new (Arthur), you need to understand:
- Where it came from (Oracle-v2 graduation)
- How it fits (recursive reincarnation pattern)
- What infrastructure exists (MCP, graph, skills)
- What's possible (documentation templates, Three.js)

**Not scattered** = building complete picture
**Not procrastination** = gathering necessary context

## Visual Evidence

Knowledge graph shows the accumulation:
- 443 nodes (documents)
- 5,278 links (connections)
- 999 markdown files (one away from 1,000)

The graph IS the external brain. The jumps are synapses firing.

## Application

When you see multiple topic switches in a session:
1. Check if they're **related** (Oracle → Arthur → visualization → skills)
2. Check if preparing for **decision/creation** (Arthur Birth ready)
3. Trust the process - context building looks messy but produces clarity

The pattern: **Explore → Connect → Understand → Act**

Not: Plan → Execute (too rigid)

## Private Class Note

This happened in private repo (Nat-s-Agents) where exploration is safe. Public repos need more focused execution. Private = lab, Public = production.
