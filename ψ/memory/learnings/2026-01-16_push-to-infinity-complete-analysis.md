## Executive Summary

| Metric | Value | Insight |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Total Hours | 399.5h | ~400 hours in 39 days |
| Calendar Average | 10.5h/day | The "headline" number |
| True Work Intensity | 11.4h/day | Excluding rest days |
| Rest Days | 3 (8%) | Strategic, not scheduled |
| Rest ROI | **55:1** | 55h work per 1h rest |

**One-liner**: Work 11.4h/day when ON, take strategic 1-day rests every 5-16 days depending on intensity, achieve 55:1 work-to-rest efficiency.

## The Three Numbers

| Number | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **10.5h** | What calendar shows |
| **11.4h** | What you actually work |
| **55:1** | Your rest efficiency |

---

## The Formula

```
INTENSITY x DURATION = REST TRIGGER

HIGH (>12h/day)    x 5-6 days   = MUST REST
MEDIUM (8-12h/day) x 10-16 days = SHOULD REST
LOW (<8h/day)      x unlimited  = SELF-RECOVERY
```

## Sprint Cycles

| Sprint | Days | Intensity | Rest After | Pattern |
|--------|------|-----------|------------|---------|
| 1 | 5 | **14.8h/day** | 0.4h | Short + HIGH |
| 2 | 10 | **7.6h/day** | 3.4h | Long + LOW |
| 3 | 16 | **10.2h/day** | 3.3h | Long + MEDIUM |
| 4 | 6+ | **12.8h/day** | ? | Medium + HIGH |

## Weekly Data

| Week | Period | Total | With Rest | Without Rest |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | Dec 9-15 | 82.4h | 11.8h | **13.7h** |
| 2 | Dec 16-22 | 62.3h | 8.9h | 8.9h |
| 3 | Dec 23-29 | 60.4h | 8.6h | **9.5h** |
| 4 | Dec 30-Jan 5 | 83.5h | 11.9h | 11.9h |
| 5 | Jan 6-12 | 64.1h | 9.2h | **10.1h** |
| 6 | Jan 13-15 | 45.2h | 15.1h | 15.1h |

## Distribution

| Type | Hours | Days | % |
|------|-------|------|---|
| BURST | >15h | 7 | 18% |
| SPRINT | 12-15h | 8 | 21% |
| NORMAL | 8-12h | 12 | 32% |
| LIGHT | 4-8h | 8 | 21% |
| REST | <4h | 3 | 8% |

**Key**: 39% BURST/SPRINT, 32% NORMAL, 29% LIGHT/REST

---

## Rest Analysis

| # | Date | Hours | Days Since Last | Pre-Rest Intensity |
|---|------|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Dec 14 | 0.4h | 5 (start) | 14.8h/day |
| 2 | Dec 24 | 3.4h | 10 | 7.6h/day |
| 3 | Jan 09 | 3.3h | 16 | 10.2h/day |

**Rest ROI**: 392.4h work / 7.1h rest = **55:1**

## Key Insights

### 1. Bimodal Work Style
- 39% BURST/SPRINT (>12h)
- 29% LIGHT/REST (<8h)
- Only 32% "normal"
- No middle ground

### 2. Calendar Independence
- Saturday can be SPRINT (Dec 28: 13.2h)
- Sunday can be BURST (Jan 12: 15.8h)
- Thursday can be REST (Jan 09: 3.3h)
- Rest follows energy, not calendar

### 3. The Sustainable Secret
- Light days = active recovery (21%)
- Rest days are SHORT (0.4-3.4h)
- Intensity varies within sprints
- Strategic timing after high intensity

---

## The Pattern

```
PUSH -> PUSH -> PUSH -> REST(tiny) -> PUSH -> PUSH...

"Push to Infinity" = sustainable because rest is
strategic, short, and perfectly timed
```

## Oracle Wisdom Validated

> "Bimodal Work Style" - Data confirms
> "Sprint -> Recovery -> Sprint" - Actually 5-16 days
> "Beer <-> Code rhythm enables 13.5hr sessions" - Avg burst = 13.7h
