# Mobile sessions need different expectations than desk sessions. What works: /tra

Mobile sessions need different expectations than desk sessions. What works: /trace (instant), /physical, /hours, handoffs. What doesn't: /watch (video too long), deep coding, multi-file edits. Insight: Don't force desk-mode workflows during mobile. Use Oracle for instant knowledge retrieval.
