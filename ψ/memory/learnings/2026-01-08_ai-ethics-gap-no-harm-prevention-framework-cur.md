# AI Ethics Gap: No Harm Prevention Framework

AI Ethics Gap: No Harm Prevention Framework

**Current State**:
- Operational safety exists (CLAUDE_safety.md)
- Psychology boundaries documented (personal insight, not therapy)
- BUT: No explicit ethical responsibility framework

**Critical Gaps for Psychology**:
| Gap | Status |
|-----|--------|
| Harm prevention protocols | MISSING |
| Bias/fairness guidelines | MISSING |
| Informed consent patterns | MISSING |
| Crisis response protocols | MISSING |
| Vulnerable population safeguards | MISSING |
| Therapeutic relationship boundaries | MISSING |
| Cultural sensitivity framework | PARTIAL (Thai only) |
| Validation/reliability disclaimers | MISSING |
| Ethics review process (IRB) | MISSING |

**Why This Matters**:
Psychology curriculum cannot use AI tools without:
- Clear harm prevention
- Crisis escalation paths
- Bias awareness training
- Informed consent practices

**Action Needed**:
Create ethical responsibility framework covering all gaps above.
