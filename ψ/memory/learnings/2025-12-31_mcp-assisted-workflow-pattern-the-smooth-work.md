# **MCP-Assisted Workflow Pattern**

**MCP-Assisted Workflow Pattern**

The smooth workflow uses MCP tools proactively, not reactively:

**Start of session**:
- `handoff_read` - Load previous context
- `oracle_search` - Find relevant patterns

**During work**:
- `oracle_consult` - Get guidance for decisions (use simple queries, avoid special chars)
- Work naturally, tools support don't interrupt

**End of session**:
- `oracle_learn` - Capture new patterns discovered
- `handoff_create` - Preserve context for next session

**Key principle**: Tools should feel like extensions of thinking, not interruptions. Use them when natural, not forced.
