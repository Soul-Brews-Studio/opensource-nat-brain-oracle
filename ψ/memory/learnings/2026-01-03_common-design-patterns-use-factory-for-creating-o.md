# Common design patterns: Use Factory for creating objects without specifying clas

Common design patterns: Use Factory for creating objects without specifying class. Use Singleton sparingly - often better as module exports. Use Strategy for swappable algorithms. Use Observer/PubSub for event-driven decoupling. Use Adapter to wrap incompatible interfaces. Prefer composition and simple functions over complex patterns in JS/TS.
