## The Pattern

**Different course durations serve different audiences entirely.**

| Duration | Audience | Need | Commitment |
|----------|----------|------|------------|
| 2 days | Working professionals | Quick skill | Low |
| 1-2 weeks | Serious learners | Deep dive | Medium |
| 6 months | Career changers | Transformation | High |

## Key Insight

**Not competing — complementary positioning.**

โค้ชเอก (6 months) and our workshops (2 days) are **different games**:

| Dimension | Long-form Bootcamp | Short Workshop |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Promise | "เปลี่ยนสายงาน" | "แก้ปัญหาได้เลย" |
| Philosophy | "เข้าใจก่อนใช้" | "ใช้แล้วเข้าใจ" |
| Risk | High (6 mo + ฿45k) | Low (2 days + ฿5k) |
| Output | Portfolio + Cert | Working prototype |
| Validation | Certificate | Results |

## Market Gap Identified

```
6 months (฿45k)  →  GAP  ←  2 days (฿5-25k)
```

**Gap opportunity**: 1-2 week intensive (฿15-30k)
- Deeper than workshop
- Less scary than 6 months
- "AI Builder Bootcamp" format

## Pricing Insight

| Course | Price | Hours | Price/Hour |
|--------|-------|-------|------------|
| โค้ชเอก | ฿29,900 | 84h | ฿356/h |
| AI Automation | ฿4,900 | 12h | ฿408/h |
| AI Builder | ฿25,000 | 12h | ฿2,083/h |

**Observation**: Premium short workshops can charge more per hour because they solve immediate problems. Long bootcamps need lower per-hour rates to justify commitment.

## Philosophy Comparison

| Traditional (โค้ชเอก) | Our Approach |
|----------------------|--------------|
| "AI ทำให้ละเลยพื้นฐาน" | "AI ช่วยให้สร้างได้เร็ว" |
| Read code before write | Build to understand |
| Fundamentals first | Outcomes first |
| Long-term career | Immediate results |

**Both are valid** — serve different needs.

## Action Items

- [ ] Consider 1-2 week intensive format
- [ ] Keep 2-day workshops as core offering
- [ ] Don't try to compete on certification (not our game)
- [ ] Focus on "real problems, real outputs"
