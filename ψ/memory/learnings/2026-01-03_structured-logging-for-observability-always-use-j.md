# Structured logging for observability: Always use JSON format for machine parsing

Structured logging for observability: Always use JSON format for machine parsing. Include correlation IDs across service boundaries. Log at appropriate levels (debug/info/warn/error). Add context fields (userId, requestId, duration). Use sampling for high-volume debug logs. Integrate with tracing (OpenTelemetry) for distributed systems.
