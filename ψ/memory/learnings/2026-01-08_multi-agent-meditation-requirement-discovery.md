# Multi-Agent Meditation Requirement

Multi-Agent Meditation Requirement

**Discovery**: "ถ้าจะควบคุม ต้องถึงขั้นเลเวลนั่งสมาธิ"
(To control Multi-Agent systems, you need meditation-level focus)

**Why This Matters**:
- 5 agents working in parallel = intense cognitive load
- Commits flying, ideas manifesting faster than comprehension
- Casual attention insufficient

**GAP IDENTIFIED**:
- Philosophy documented (Month 7-8 insight)
- But NO practice guide exists
- No "how to achieve" meditation-level control

**Psychological Implication**:
- AI tools demand higher self-regulation
- May serve as forcing function for mindfulness training
- Connection to Buddhist practice: present-moment awareness

**For Curriculum**:
- Teach attention training alongside AI skills
- "Deep presence required for powerful tools"
