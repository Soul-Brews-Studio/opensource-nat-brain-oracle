# Code review best practices: Keep PRs small (<400 lines) for effective review. Re

Code review best practices: Keep PRs small (<400 lines) for effective review. Review for correctness, security, and maintainability - not style (use linters). Ask questions rather than make demands. Approve with minor comments if changes are trivial. Use draft PRs for early feedback. Respond to reviews within 24 hours. Automate what can be automated.
