# Modal/dialog implementation: Trap focus inside modal when open. Return focus to 

Modal/dialog implementation: Trap focus inside modal when open. Return focus to trigger element on close. Close on Escape key and overlay click. Use aria-modal and role="dialog". Prevent body scroll when open. Use portal to render at document root. Animate enter/exit for polish. Stack modals properly if nesting required.
