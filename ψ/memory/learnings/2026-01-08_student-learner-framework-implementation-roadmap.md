# Student Learner Framework: Implementation Roadmap

Student Learner Framework: Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation**
- Map existing course structure to Bloom's Taxonomy
- Define learning objectives (observable outcomes)
- Identify scaffolding points (demo → practice)
- Create Zone of Proximal Development checkpoints

**Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Structure**
- Build assessment rubrics (self, peer, facilitator)
- Design feedback loops (immediate, actionable, psychologically-safe)
- Create progression markers
- Document adaptation rules

**Phase 3 (Weeks 5+): Delivery**
- Pilot with first course (Self-Awareness Foundations)
- Capture student learning curves via retrospectives
- Refine scaffolding based on actual data
- Build psychology-specific lesson library

**Key Psychology Courses Ready**:
| Course | Duration | Method |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Self-Awareness Foundations | 3h | Demo + reflection |
| Understanding Personality | 6h | Conceptual + self-assessment |
| Emotional Intelligence | 4h | Demo + role-play |
| Therapeutic Conversation | 2 days | Practice + feedback |

**Estimated Effort**: ~50-65 hours for first course
