# SQL injection prevention: Always use parameterized queries or prepared statement

SQL injection prevention: Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements - never string concatenation. Use ORM query builders that escape by default. Validate and sanitize input, but don't rely on it alone. Apply principle of least privilege to database users. Use stored procedures for complex queries.
