## The Real Story

90/10 is NOT a fixed work-rest balance. It's a **dynamic ratio that shifts based on life phase**.

### Nat's Journey

| Phase | Years | Ratio | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Pain** | Before 2019 | 100% code | Office syndrome, body broken |
| **Recovery** | 2019-2024 | 90% beer, 10% code | Escape stress, learn brewing, use body |
| **Integration** | 2025+ | 90% AI, 10% beer | Beer done, foundation set, accelerate |

---

## Key Insight

**Before**: 90% energy → brewing (7 years of investment)
- Physical work, high cost (money + body + time)
- Necessary escape from desk work stress
- Building a foundation

**Now**: 90% energy → AI/software
- Brewing = **complete** (mastered, product exists)
- Beer = "podkat" (product/foundation/trust signal)
- Energy returned → can accelerate in high-leverage work

## The Economics

| Activity | Productivity per Hour |
|----------|----------------------|
| Physical brewing | Low (body-intensive, high cost) |
| AI/Software | **High** (leverage, scalable, teachable) |

**7 years of brewing = foundation built**
**Now: accelerate in what has highest leverage**

## Updated Understanding

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| 90% work, 10% rest | Dynamic ratio based on life phase |
| Fixed balance | Shifts as projects complete |
| Beer = rest/escape | Beer = **completed product** |
| Code = work | AI = **acceleration zone** |

---

## The Pattern

```
Phase 1: Invest heavily in one area (90%)
         ↓
Phase 2: Complete/master it
         ↓
Phase 3: It becomes foundation (10%)
         ↓
Phase 4: Shift energy to next acceleration (90%)
```

This is not balance. This is **strategic energy allocation across life phases**.

## Connection to Oracle Philosophy

This is why "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human":
- AI accelerates the 90% work phase
- Work finishes faster → more freedom
- Freedom → time for human connection
- Human connection = the actual goal
