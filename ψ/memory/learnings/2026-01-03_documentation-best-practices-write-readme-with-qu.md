# Documentation best practices: Write README with quick start, installation, and e

Documentation best practices: Write README with quick start, installation, and examples. Use JSDoc/TSDoc for inline API documentation. Generate API docs automatically from code. Document the why, not just the what. Keep docs close to code to stay in sync. Include architecture decision records (ADRs) for major choices. Update docs as part of PR process.
