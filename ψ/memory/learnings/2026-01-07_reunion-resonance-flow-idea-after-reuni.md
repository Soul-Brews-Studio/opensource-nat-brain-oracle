# ## Reunion → Resonance Flow

## Reunion → Resonance Flow

**Idea**: After reunion syncs learnings, prompt if pattern is CORE enough for resonance.

### Flow
```
/project reunion [slug]
        ↓
    Sync learnings to Oracle
        ↓
    Analyze: Is this pattern CORE?
        ↓
    If yes → Prompt: "Add to resonance?"
        ↓
    User confirms → Copy to ψ/memory/resonance/
```

### What Goes to Resonance

| Learnings (patterns) | Resonance (soul) |
|---------------------|------------------|
| How to do X | WHO you are |
| Technical patterns | Core beliefs |
| Session discoveries | Identity-defining patterns |

### Example

```
/project reunion headline-rag
→ Found 3 new learnings
→ One learning: "Always prefer simplicity over flexibility"
→ Prompt: "This seems like a CORE pattern. Add to resonance?"
→ User: yes
→ Added to ψ/memory/resonance/patterns.md
```

### Why This Matters

Resonance = soul-level patterns that define identity.
Not every learning is resonance-worthy.
Reunion provides the gate for promoting learnings to resonance.
