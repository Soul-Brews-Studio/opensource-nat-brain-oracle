# List virtualization/windowing: Only render visible items plus buffer for large l

List virtualization/windowing: Only render visible items plus buffer for large lists. Use react-window or @tanstack/react-virtual. Calculate item heights for variable-size lists. Maintain scroll position on data changes. Virtualization essential for 1000+ items. Trade-off: more complex implementation, keyboard nav needs care. Consider pagination as simpler alternative.
