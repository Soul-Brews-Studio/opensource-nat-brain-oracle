# Clipboard API: Use navigator.clipboard.writeText() for modern copy. Fallback to 

Clipboard API: Use navigator.clipboard.writeText() for modern copy. Fallback to execCommand('copy') for older browsers. Requires user gesture (click event). Show visual feedback on copy success. Handle errors gracefully - clipboard access may be denied. Use readText() for paste with user permission. Consider security implications of clipboard access.
