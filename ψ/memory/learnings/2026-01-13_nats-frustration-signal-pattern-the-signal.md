# # Nat's Frustration Signal Pattern

# Nat's Frustration Signal Pattern

## The Signal

When Nat says:
> "why you still do this... still error? always error... do this again and again... very long time... very weird"

**This means**: Frustration threshold reached. Same error repeated too many times.

## What AI Must Do

1. **STOP** current approach
2. **Fix root cause** — not another workaround
3. **Don't explain** — just fix
4. **Different approach** if same thing keeps failing

## The Pattern

```
Error once → OK, try again
Error twice → Warning sign
Error 3+ times → "why still... always error..."
                 ↓
            STOP. FIX ROOT CAUSE NOW.
```

## Key Insight

Repeated errors = wasted time and energy.
Recognizing this signal = prevent frustration cycles.

When you hear "why still... always error..." — it's time to change approach, not try again.
