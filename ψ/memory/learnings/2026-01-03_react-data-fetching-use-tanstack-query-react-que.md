# React data fetching: Use TanStack Query (React Query) or SWR for server state. T

React data fetching: Use TanStack Query (React Query) or SWR for server state. They handle caching, deduplication, and background refetching. Separate server state from client state. Use staleTime to control refetch frequency. Prefetch data on hover for instant navigation. Implement error boundaries for fetch failures. Consider SSR/SSG for initial data.
