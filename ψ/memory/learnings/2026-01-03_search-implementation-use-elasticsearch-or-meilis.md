# Search implementation: Use Elasticsearch or Meilisearch for full-text search at 

Search implementation: Use Elasticsearch or Meilisearch for full-text search at scale. Implement fuzzy matching and typo tolerance. Use analyzers for language-specific stemming. Index only searchable fields, store full docs elsewhere. Implement search-as-you-type with debouncing. Cache frequent queries. Monitor search analytics for relevance tuning.
