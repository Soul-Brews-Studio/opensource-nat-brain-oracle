# ASYNC WORK PATTERN: Sleep While Agents Work

ASYNC WORK PATTERN: Sleep While Agents Work

Session 2026-01-09 → 2026-01-10 demonstrated async AI collaboration:

TIMELINE:
- 21:16 - Session starts (Google vs Oracle comparison)
- 21:30 - Discovered AlchemyCat
- 22:02 - Launched 20 Haiku agents (2 iterations of 10)
- 22:03 - Agents complete extraction
- ~22:10 - Nat goes to sleep
- 06:30 - Nat wakes up, continues session
- 06:49 - Research fully documented

THE PATTERN:
1. Human identifies task (analyze AlchemyCat)
2. Launch parallel agents (20 Haiku)
3. Agents complete work (~minutes)
4. Human sleeps (~8 hours)
5. Human returns, synthesizes results
6. Document findings

WHAT HAPPENED OVERNIGHT:
- Agents extracted 459 commits worth of data
- 52,896 words processed
- All findings ready when human returned

WHY THIS WORKS:
- Agents do heavy lifting (bulk extraction)
- Human does synthesis (meaning-making)
- Sleep doesn't block progress
- Results waiting in morning

RESULT:
- 4 Oracle learnings created
- Full research document (4,500 words)
- Origin story understood
- Timeline documented

This is "External Brain, Not Command" in practice — AI works, human rests, collaboration continues.
