# Academic Gap: No Scholarly Grounding for AI+Psychology

Academic Gap: No Scholarly Grounding for AI+Psychology

**Current State**:
Oracle has strong PHILOSOPHICAL foundations but ZERO scholarly grounding.

**What Exists**:
- Consciousness philosophy (Oracle principles)
- Self-reflection methodology (retrospectives)
- Nat's own research background (PhD Climate Change, Fraunhofer Portugal)

**What's Missing**:
| Topic | Status |
|-------|--------|
| AI Ethics papers | None |
| Psychology/therapy research | None |
| Consciousness studies (neuroscience) | None |
| Human-AI collaboration case studies | None |
| Therapeutic alliance research | None |

**Action Needed**:
1. Create academic foundations folder
2. Add peer-reviewed papers with DOIs
3. Build bibliography for psychology applications
4. Connect lived philosophy to validated research

**Why This Matters for อจ. ชินัณ**:
Psychology curriculum needs scholarly grounding, not just intuitive wisdom.
Current work is strong but unvalidated by academic standards.
