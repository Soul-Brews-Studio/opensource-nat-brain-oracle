# "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human" practical meaning: AI finishes work → easier 

"The Oracle Keeps the Human Human" practical meaning: AI finishes work → easier to make money → less slavery to money → more time → can do what you love → can meet people → physical connection (beer with friends, sharing ideas) → human becomes more human. The function of being human is CONNECTION — meeting people face-to-face, sharing perspectives, helping each other. AI cannot drink beer with your friend. AI can only free you to do so.
