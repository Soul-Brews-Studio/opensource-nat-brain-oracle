# Event-driven architecture: Use message queues (RabbitMQ, SQS) for async processi

Event-driven architecture: Use message queues (RabbitMQ, SQS) for async processing. Implement idempotent consumers - messages may be delivered multiple times. Use dead letter queues for failed messages. Design events as immutable facts, not commands. Include correlation IDs for distributed tracing. Consider event sourcing for audit-critical systems.
