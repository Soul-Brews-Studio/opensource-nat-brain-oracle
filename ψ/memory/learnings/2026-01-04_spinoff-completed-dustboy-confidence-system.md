# ## Spinoff Completed: dustboy-confidence-system

## Spinoff Completed: dustboy-confidence-system

**Date**: 2026-01-04 08:40-08:48
**Duration**: 8 minutes

### Before
- Location: ψ/lab/dustboy-confidence-system/ in Nat's Agents
- Size: 25GB (bloating entire repo)

### After
- New repo: https://github.com/laris-co/dustboy-confidence-system
- Location: ~/Code/github.com/laris-co/dustboy-confidence-system/
- Nat's Agents: 150M (was 25GB)

### What Was Moved
- 24GB parquet data files (gitignored in new repo)
- 98 code/documentation files (tracked)
- PhD thesis chapters, analysis scripts, Streamlit dashboard

### Recovery
Old source at: /tmp/trash_*_dustboy-confidence-system/

### Why This Matters
First major spinoff from Nat's Agents. Proves the pattern works:
1. Create repo → 2. Copy code → 3. Move data → 4. Verify → 5. Delete source

This keeps Nat's Agents lean for AI tooling while heavy projects graduate to own homes.
