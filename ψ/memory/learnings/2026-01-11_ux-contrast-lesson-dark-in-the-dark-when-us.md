# ## UX Contrast Lesson: "Dark in the Dark"

## UX Contrast Lesson: "Dark in the Dark"

When user says visibility is poor on dark background:
- Don't: Increase opacity by 0.1-0.2 (subtle adjustment)
- Do: Switch to white/bright color at 0.8+ opacity (dramatic change)

User feedback "too dark" means current approach fundamentally wrong, not slightly off. Go bright immediately, then dial back if needed.

**Anti-pattern**: 0.15 → 0.4 → 0.6 (three iterations)
**Correct**: 0.15 → 0.9 white (one iteration)
