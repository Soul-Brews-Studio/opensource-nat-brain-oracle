# ## Scene-Setting in Technical Writing

## Scene-Setting in Technical Writing

Open with atmosphere, not information.

### ❌ Wrong (Report Style)
"On January 8th, 2026, I had a conversation on Facebook about my challenge project..."

### ✅ Right (Novel Style)
"It was a Wednesday afternoon in Chiang Mai. The kind where the sun slants through coffee shop windows and you feel like you could build anything."

### Why It Works
- Reader is IN the moment
- Creates emotional investment
- Makes technical content human
- Distinguishes from AI-generated content

### Formula
[Time of day] + [Place] + [Sensory detail] + [Emotional state or activity]

Examples:
- "It was 3am. The kind of 3am where bugs feel personal."
- "The coffee had gone cold. I hadn't noticed."
- "Rain on the window. Code on the screen. Something wasn't right."
