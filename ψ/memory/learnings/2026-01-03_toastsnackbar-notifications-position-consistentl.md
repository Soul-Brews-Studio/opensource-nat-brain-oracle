Toast/snackbar notifications: Position consistently (bottom-right common). Auto-dismiss after 3-5 seconds for info, persist for errors. Stack multiple toasts without overlap. Include dismiss button. Use appropriate colors (green success, red error, yellow warning). Announce to screen readers with aria-live. Limit queue to prevent spam.
