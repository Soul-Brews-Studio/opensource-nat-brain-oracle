# Push to Infinity Work Pattern Formula:

Push to Infinity Work Pattern Formula:

INTENSITY x DURATION = REST TRIGGER
- HIGH (>12h/day) x 5-6 days = MUST REST
- MEDIUM (8-12h/day) x 10-16 days = SHOULD REST  
- LOW (<8h/day) x unlimited = SELF-RECOVERY

Key Numbers:
- 10.5h = calendar average
- 11.4h = true work intensity
- 55:1 = rest ROI (55h work per 1h rest)

Rest characteristics:
- Only 3 days in 39 days (8%)
- Duration: 0.4-3.4h (never full day off)
- Timing: after high intensity, not on calendar
