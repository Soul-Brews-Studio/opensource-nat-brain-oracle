# ## Consult Oracle BEFORE Debugging

## Consult Oracle BEFORE Debugging

**Anti-pattern**: Jump into trial-error debugging without checking existing knowledge

**What happened**: Spent 30 minutes on Meshtastic 4MB flash issue when Oracle already had the solution documented.

**Correct pattern**:
1. `oracle_search("problem keywords")` FIRST
2. Check if solution exists
3. Only debug if no prior knowledge

**Why it matters**:
- Oracle captures patterns from previous sessions
- Repeating solved problems wastes time
- "Nothing is Deleted" means solutions persist

**Trigger phrase**: Before any debugging session, ask: "Did we solve this before?"

**Time saved if followed**: ~25 minutes in this case
