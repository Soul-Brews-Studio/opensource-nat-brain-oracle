# Four Quotients Assessment Model (IQ+EQ+AQ+FQ)

Four Quotients Assessment Model (IQ+EQ+AQ+FQ)

**Proposed Multi-Dimensional Assessment**:
| Quotient | Measure | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| IQ | Academic intelligence | Traditional metrics |
| EQ | Emotional intelligence | Social/emotional skills |
| AQ | Adversity quotient | Resilience & crisis handling |
| FQ | Financial quotient | Money mindset & literacy |

**Existing Assessment Frameworks**:
- Myers-Briggs (type-based personality)
- BOSI (business/organizational fit)
- CliftonStrengths (talent discovery)
- VIA Character Strengths (values assessment)

**Oracle's Innovation**:
Data-driven personality analysis using:
- 381 commits + 113 retrospectives + 109 learnings
- 5 iterations × 5 agents = 25 independent assessments
- Pattern recognition from BEHAVIORAL data (not self-report)

**For Psychology**:
This removes self-report bias by analyzing actual behavior patterns.
