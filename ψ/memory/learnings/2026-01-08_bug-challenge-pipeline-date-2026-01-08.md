# ## Bug → Challenge Pipeline

## Bug → Challenge Pipeline

**Date**: 2026-01-08

### The Pattern

When you find a real bug, turn it into a teaching challenge:

1. **Document the journey** — Timeline, failed attempts, breakthrough
2. **Create challenge files** — Some broken, some valid (decoys)
3. **Hide the answer** — Store in Oracle, not in repo
4. **Storytelling** — Real dates, real emotions, real frustration → credibility
5. **Challenge hook** — "Can you find it faster than we did?"

### Why It Works

- **Real bugs = credibility** — Not contrived, actually happened
- **Your pain = their learning** — Turn debugging frustration into teaching
- **Methodology transfer** — Binary search, isolation, documentation

### Example

```
07:50 — Update Claude Code, crash
08:25 — Try 4 fixes, all fail
08:25 — Isolate everything → works!
08:34 — Binary search → found 6 files
09:00 — Create MISSION-02 challenge
```

### The Transformation

| Your Experience | Their Challenge |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Frustration | Engagement |
| Trial & error | Methodology |
| Discovery | Achievement |
| Documentation | Blog post |

> "The bug that frustrated us becomes the lesson that teaches others."
