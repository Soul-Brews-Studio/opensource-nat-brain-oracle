# ## Long-Run Practice Pattern

## Long-Run Practice Pattern

When running extended practice sessions:

1. **Trust the MCPs** - Oracle, Handoff, Claude-mem persist context across compacts
2. **Auto-compact enabled** - Don't fear context limits, system handles summarization
3. **Clean as you go** - Commit frequently, small batches
4. **Capture learnings immediately** - Oracle learn after each insight
5. **Handoff before breaks** - Not at context limit, but at natural pause points

### Flow
```
Work → Commit → Learn → Continue
         ↓
    (auto-compact happens)
         ↓
    MCP restores context → Continue
```

### Key: No fear of context. MCPs are the external brain.
