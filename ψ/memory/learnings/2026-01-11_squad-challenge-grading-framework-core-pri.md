# ## Squad Challenge Grading Framework

## Squad Challenge Grading Framework

### Core Principles

1. **Results Matter**: Did they solve the problem? (not how they solved it)
2. **Documentation Required**: Timestamps, steps, methodology
3. **Blog is REQUIRED**: "เรียนฟรี แต่ช่วยกันส่งต่อความรู้"
4. **Creative Approaches Welcome**: Alternative solutions get credit
5. **Provisional Until Published**: All scores pending blog link

### Standard Rubric (100 points)

| Category | Points | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Core Task** | 30-40 | Did they complete the main objective? |
| **Understanding** | 20 | Root cause / why it works |
| **Documentation** | 20 | Timestamps, steps, methodology |
| **Extras** | 10-20 | Bonus challenges, creative solutions |
| **Blog** | 10 | Published on Medium |
