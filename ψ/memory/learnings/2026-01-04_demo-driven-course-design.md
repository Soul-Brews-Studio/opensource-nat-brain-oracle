# Demo-Driven Course Design

**Date**: 2026-01-04

## What We Learned

- **Best course demo is a real session** - The Tingting call became the course template
- **From problem to prototype in 15 minutes** proves the value proposition
- **Students must bring their own problems** - Not hypothetical exercises
- **Independence is the goal** - Not just "learned to use a tool"

## Pattern: Session → Course

```
Live session with real user
    ↓
Document what worked
    ↓
Extract the pattern
    ↓
Design course around it
```

## Key Insight

> "การไปทำคอร์สสอน AI มันก็จะต้องประมาณนี้แหละ"

The best AI course isn't about teaching AI - it's about:
1. ทำโจทย์ที่ลูกค้าสนใจ (work on their real problem)
2. ไปทำต่อเองได้ (continue independently)
3. ขึ้นโปรเจ็คเองได้ (set up their own projects)
4. Get all context / engineer the system (own the workflow)

## How Things Connect

- SIIT Workshop (Dec 26) → Theory-heavy, less hands-on
- Tingting Session (Jan 4) → Pure practice, real output
- AI Builder Workshop → Combines both: minimal theory + maximum practice

## Course Philosophy

| Old Way | New Way |
|---------|---------|
| Teach tools | Solve problems |
| Example projects | Their projects |
| "You learned X" | "You built X" |
| Certificate | Working prototype |
