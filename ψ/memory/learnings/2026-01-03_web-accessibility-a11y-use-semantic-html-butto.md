# Web accessibility (a11y): Use semantic HTML (button, nav, main) over divs. Add A

Web accessibility (a11y): Use semantic HTML (button, nav, main) over divs. Add ARIA labels only when HTML semantics aren't enough. Ensure keyboard navigation (tab order, focus states). Maintain 4.5:1 color contrast ratio. Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA). Use skip links for navigation. Never rely on color alone for meaning.
