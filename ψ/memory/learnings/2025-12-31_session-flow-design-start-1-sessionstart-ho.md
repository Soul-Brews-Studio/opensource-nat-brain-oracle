# **Session Flow Design**

**Session Flow Design**

Start:
1. SessionStart hook shows latest handoff
2. oracle_search for relevant patterns if needed
3. Begin work with context loaded

During:
- Work naturally, tools support don't interrupt
- oracle_search when genuinely need patterns
- git commit regularly for recoverable state
- oracle_learn when discover something new

End:
1. Commit all work
2. Create handoff while context fresh
3. oracle_learn final patterns

Key: Tools are extensions of thinking, not checkboxes to tick.
