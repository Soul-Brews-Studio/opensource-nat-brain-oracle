# Database indexing and query optimization: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand quer

Database indexing and query optimization: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand query plans. Index columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY. Composite indexes follow leftmost prefix rule. Avoid indexing low-cardinality columns. Monitor slow query logs. Consider partial indexes for filtered queries. Index maintenance has write overhead - don't over-index.
