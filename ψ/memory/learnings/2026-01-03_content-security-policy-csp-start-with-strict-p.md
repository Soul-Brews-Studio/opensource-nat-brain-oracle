# Content Security Policy (CSP): Start with strict policy and loosen as needed. Us

Content Security Policy (CSP): Start with strict policy and loosen as needed. Use nonces or hashes for inline scripts, avoid 'unsafe-inline'. Set default-src 'self' as baseline. Use report-uri to collect violations before enforcing. Test in report-only mode first. Block mixed content with upgrade-insecure-requests.
