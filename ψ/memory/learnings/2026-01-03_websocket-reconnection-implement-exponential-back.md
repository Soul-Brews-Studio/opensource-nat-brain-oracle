# WebSocket reconnection: Implement exponential backoff with jitter for retries. U

WebSocket reconnection: Implement exponential backoff with jitter for retries. Use heartbeat/ping-pong to detect dead connections early. Store last message ID for resumption. Show connection status to users. Queue messages during disconnection. Set reasonable timeouts (30s ping, 60s pong). Handle browser tab visibility changes.
