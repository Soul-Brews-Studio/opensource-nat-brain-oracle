# ## Course Design Pattern: Template vs Skill

## Course Design Pattern: Template vs Skill

Two approaches to teaching automation:

### Template Approach (Sadhu-style)
- Give pre-built workflows
- Students copy and use
- Fast to market
- High scale (video)
- Low price works
- BUT: dependency, can't modify, buy again

### Skill Approach (Our style)  
- Teach methodology
- Students build own solutions
- Slower but deeper
- Limited scale (live)
- Higher price justified
- BUT: requires student effort

### Key Insight
```
Template = ให้ปลา (eat once)
Skill = สอนตกปลา (eat forever)
```

Choose based on:
- Target audience willingness to learn
- Price point you want
- Scale you need
- Long-term relationship goal
