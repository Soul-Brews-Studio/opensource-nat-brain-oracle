# Session Pattern: Pure MCP Breakthrough Validation

Session Pattern: Pure MCP Breakthrough Validation

A single session can validate a major architectural pattern through iterative testing:
1. Propose integration idea (Ralph Loop + Forum)
2. Test with Ralph Loop (7 iterations, EXIT_LOOP works)
3. Document pattern (snapshot)
4. Test again to confirm (13 iterations, EXIT_LOOP works again)
5. Write ultrathink retrospective (capture significance)
6. Add to Oracle (permanent knowledge)
7. Sync to all agents (distribute knowledge)

Key insight: Forum-based exit condition solves the Ralph Loop infinite firing problem. Any agent can post EXIT_LOOP to stop any other agent's loop. This is the foundation for multi-agent coordination without external orchestration.

The door was never locked. We just needed to try the handle.
