# Cognitive Decision Modes by Pressure Level

Cognitive Decision Modes by Pressure Level

**Decision-Making Architecture**:

| Mode | Pressure | Pattern |
|------|----------|---------|
| Normal | Low | Question → Experiment → Data → Reflect → Pattern |
| Pressure | High | Assume → Execute → Feedback → Correct |
| Teaching | Medium | Demo → Mistake → Correction → Learning |

**Bimodal Work Pattern**:
- Either intense (12-14h) OR light (<3h)
- No middle ground
- Sprint → Recovery → Sprint (3-4 day cycles)
- Peak hours: 10:00, 14:00, 22:00

**Cognitive Load Limit**:
- Max 5 concurrent projects
- 5 agents in parallel = meditation-level focus required

**Key Bias**:
Over-assumption under urgency (15+ documented instances)

**Preference Hierarchy**:
1. Simple > Complex
2. Working code > Perfect design
3. Iterate fast > Plan long
4. Avoid premature abstraction

**For Psychology**:
Understanding these patterns helps design AI tools that match human cognitive capacity.
