# Full Speckit Workflow Mastery Pattern

Full Speckit Workflow Mastery Pattern

After 6 CLI apps in one session, the speckit workflow is now muscle memory:

1. `/speckit.specify` - Creates branch, spec.md, checklist
2. `/speckit.plan` - Generates plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md
3. `/speckit.tasks` - Creates tasks.md with phases and [P] markers
4. `/speckit.implement` - Executes tasks, marks [x] as complete

Key acceleration factors:
- Proven tech stack (Bun + Drizzle + Commander.js) = no decision fatigue
- Task phases (Setup → Foundational → User Stories → Polish) = clear order
- Reusable patterns = copy-adapt from previous CLI

Time progression: 10 min → 5 min → 3 min → 2 min per app
