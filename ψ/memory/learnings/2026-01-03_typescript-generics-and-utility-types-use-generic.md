# TypeScript generics and utility types: Use generics for reusable type-safe funct

TypeScript generics and utility types: Use generics for reusable type-safe functions and components. Master built-in utilities: Partial, Required, Pick, Omit, Record. Use conditional types for type-level logic. Leverage infer for extracting types. Constrain generics with extends. Prefer inference over explicit type arguments when possible.
