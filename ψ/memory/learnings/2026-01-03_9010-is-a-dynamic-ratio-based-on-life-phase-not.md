90/10 is a Dynamic Ratio Based on Life Phase, not a fixed work-rest balance. The pattern: (1) Invest 90% in one area until mastery, (2) Complete it, (3) It becomes foundation/product at 10%, (4) Shift 90% energy to next acceleration zone. Example: 2019-2024 was 90% beer building foundation. 2025+ is 90% AI/software acceleration, with beer as completed product (podkat). When something is complete, it becomes your foundation. Then you accelerate in the next high-leverage area.
