# ## Command Naming: Easy to Type

## Command Naming: Easy to Type

When naming commands/short codes, prioritize typing ergonomics:

**Good examples:**
- `rrr` - 3 chars, same finger
- `gogogo` - alternating, easy rhythm
- `ccc` - compact, memorable

**Anti-patterns:**
- `/project search` - 15 chars before query
- Long prefixes that require thought

**Key insight**: Users type commands many times per day. Friction compounds.

**Consider:**
- Single-word commands when possible
- Aliases for frequent operations
- Muscle memory patterns (repeated chars, alternating hands)
