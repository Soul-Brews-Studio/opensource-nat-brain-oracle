# Low Git ≠ Low Work - Mode Switching Pattern

## The Discovery

When analyzing 39 days of work data, "rest days" (<4h git activity) turned out to be something else entirely:

| Date | Git Hours | Reality |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Dec 14 | 0.4h | Pitch prep (offline slides) |
| Dec 22 | 5.2h | Training @ Grand Centre Point |
| Dec 24 | 3.4h | Christmas (still 5 sessions!) |
| Dec 26 | 14.5h | SIIT Workshop @ TU Rangsit |
| Jan 05 | 5.7h | Workshop design + travel |
| Jan 09 | 3.3h | Oracle Tray dev (light commits) |

**True rest days: Maybe 0 in 39 days.**

## The Pattern

```
"Rest" = Mode Switching

CODE mode    → low git during switch
SLIDES mode  → Gemini, offline tools
TRAINING mode → physical event, low commits
TRAVEL mode  → moving, no coding
```

## Key Insight

**Sustainable intensity comes from mode switching, not from stopping.**

The "Push to Infinity" pattern works because:
1. Light days = active recovery (different type of work)
2. Physical events force natural breaks from code
3. Offline work (slides, planning) still productive
4. Never actually resting, just switching modes

## Formula

```
What calendar shows: 10.5h/day average
What actually happens: 11.4h/day when coding
                      + unknown hours offline
                      + event days (training/travel)
```

## Application

When analyzing work hours:
- Don't assume low git = low work
- Trace retrospectives for actual activities
- Check for physical events, offline work
- Mode switching is a valid "rest" strategy
