# Handoff Context Management: Two types exist - handoff/ (human-AI, session-to-ses

Handoff Context Management: Two types exist - handoff/ (human-AI, session-to-session) and external/ (AI-AI, agent-to-agent). Key rule: "Don't try to be smart when you're tired" - /forward at end does simple APPEND (low context), /recap at start does complex MERGE (fresh context). The 96% rule: auto-handoff triggers at 96% context usage. Mirror philosophy: /recap extracts and waits for human confirmation, never commands.
