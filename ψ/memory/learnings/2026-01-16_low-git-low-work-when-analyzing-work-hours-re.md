# Low Git ≠ Low Work: When analyzing work hours, "rest days" (<4h git) may actuall

Low Git ≠ Low Work: When analyzing work hours, "rest days" (<4h git) may actually be mode switches - physical events, offline work (slides, Gemini), or light dev days. True rest may be 0 days. Sustainable intensity comes from switching modes (code → slides → training → travel), not from stopping.
