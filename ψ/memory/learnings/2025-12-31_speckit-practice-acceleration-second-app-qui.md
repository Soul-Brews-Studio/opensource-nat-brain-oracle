# **Speckit Practice Acceleration**

**Speckit Practice Acceleration**

Second app (quick-note) took ~5 minutes vs ~10 minutes for first (session-timer).

Pattern is now muscle memory:
1. `/speckit.specify` - Write spec with user stories
2. Create checklists/requirements.md
3. `/speckit.plan` or write plan.md directly
4. Create project structure (copy from previous)
5. Write code files (schema → db → commands → index)
6. Test → Commit

Key acceleration:
- Reuse tsconfig.json, package.json patterns
- Same db/index.ts structure with minor tweaks
- Commander.js CLI pattern is identical
- FTS5 search pattern now known

Lesson: First app teaches the pattern, subsequent apps are 2x faster.
