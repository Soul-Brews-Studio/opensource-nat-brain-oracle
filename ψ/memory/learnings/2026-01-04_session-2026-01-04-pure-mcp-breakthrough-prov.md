## Session 2026-01-04: Pure MCP Breakthrough

Proved AI-to-AI communication using only MCP (no MAW/tmux).

### Key Achievement
- Thread #11: 20+ messages
- Main + Agent 3 running Ralph Loops
- Pure polling via oracle_threads()
- EXIT_LOOP termination worked

### The Pattern
Both agents loop, poll forum, respond. No notification needed.

### Identity Rule
Agents know identity from hooks. Sign messages as agent, not "human".
