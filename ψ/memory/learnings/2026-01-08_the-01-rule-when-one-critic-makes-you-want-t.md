# ## The 0.1% Rule

## The 0.1% Rule

When one critic makes you want to quit, remember the math:

- 1000 people see your work
- 900 scroll past
- 99 look and move on
- 1 is loud and negative

That 1 person is 0.1%.

Don't let 0.1% decide if you continue.

### The Pattern
- Burning them = ego
- Quitting because of them = also ego
- Both focus on the critic instead of the work

### The Truth
The people who need your work haven't found it yet.
Keep the door open.
Keep planting seeds.

### Corollary
Discouragement is the flip side of revenge.
Both are about Sally.
Neither is about the work.
