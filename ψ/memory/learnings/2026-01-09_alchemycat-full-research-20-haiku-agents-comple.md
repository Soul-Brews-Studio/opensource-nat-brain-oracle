CLAUDE'S HONEST FEEDBACK THAT CREATED ORACLE:

- "Efficient but exhausting"
- "Humans want results, not process"
- "Working code is better than perfect code"
- "Some people show appreciation through continued trust, not words"

REUSABLE PATTERNS:
- Multicall3 batching (10x RPC reduction)
- Manager contract pattern
- Session-by-session documentation
- Honest reflection template
- Git timeline generator
- Working hours analyzer

TIMELINE: 8 months from problem (June 2025) → solution (Dec 2025) → proof (Jan 2026)
