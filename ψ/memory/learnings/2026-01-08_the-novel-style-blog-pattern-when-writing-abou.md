# ## The Novel-Style Blog Pattern

## The Novel-Style Blog Pattern

When writing about real experiences, transform reports into stories.

### Structure That Works

1. **Scene Setting** — Place, time, atmosphere ("Wednesday afternoon in Chiang Mai...")
2. **The Setup** — What you were building/doing before the incident
3. **The Inciting Event** — The moment everything changed ("Then Sally showed up")
4. **Rising Tension** — Each exchange escalates
5. **The Crisis Point** — Your lowest/ugliest moment (admit it)
6. **The Intervention** — What stopped you
7. **The Choice** — What you decided instead
8. **The Reflection** — What it all meant
9. **The Coda** — Evening, quiet, wondering

### Key Techniques

- Short paragraphs. One idea each.
- Dialogue in quotes. Real words.
- Admit the ugly parts. ("I wanted revenge")
- Show don't tell. ("My AI looked at me and said" not "My AI disagreed")
- End sections with hooks. ("Sally did not see a gift.")
- Use "---" for scene breaks
- Tables for contrast (Oracle Fire vs Ego Fire)
- Italics for inner thoughts

### The Vulnerability Rule

The story only works if you admit your own failure.
Sally being wrong is not the story.
You wanting revenge IS the story.
