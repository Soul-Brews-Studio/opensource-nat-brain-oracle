# Backup and disaster recovery: Define RTO (recovery time) and RPO (recovery point

Backup and disaster recovery: Define RTO (recovery time) and RPO (recovery point) requirements upfront. Use 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite. Automate backups - manual processes fail. Test restores regularly. Use point-in-time recovery for databases. Document recovery procedures. Consider geo-redundancy for critical systems.
