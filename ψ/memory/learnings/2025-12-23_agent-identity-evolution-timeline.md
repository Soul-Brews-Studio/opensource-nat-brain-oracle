# AI Agent Identity Evolution Timeline

## Overview
This document traces the development of agent identity definitions across the Nat's Agents system, from initial philosophy work through multi-iteration personality analysis.

## Phase 3: Data-Driven Analysis (Dec 18)

### 2025-12-18 07:50 | Personality v1 from Actual Data
**Commit**: 6ec0d49
- **Created**: ψ/memory/resonance/personality-v1.md

  - Weekend warrior on Sat (20% activity)
  - Add:Delete ratio 14.8:1 (builder, not destroyer)
  - Session types: Burst (6-22m), Deep Work (1.5-3h), Marathon (5-6h), All-nighter (19+h)
  
### 2025-12-18 08:10 | Personality v2 from 5 Iterations of Verification

    3. Community (Chiang Mai Maker Club, trust-building)
  - **Life Arc**: Before Beer → Beer Era (2017-24, 90% beer building foundation) → Now (2025+, 90% AI acceleration, beer as completed product)
  - **Vision**: "Create AI to reduce work → Have time for beer + reading + living"
  - **Note**: 90/10 is a dynamic ratio based on life phase, not a fixed balance
  - All work patterns from v1 confirmed + deepened

**Commit**: 1b3bcd2
- **Retrospective**: 53-minute focused session on personality evolution
- Documented evolution path from v1 to v2
- Oracle philosophy alignment checking

---

## Phase 4: Soul & Vision Expansion (Dec 20)

### 2025-12-20 10:58 | Soul Philosophy Timeline
**Commit**: 31442f1
- Updated schedule
- **Added**: Soul philosophy timeline
- Connected identity to broader vision work

## Agent Identity in Practice

### Subagent Identity Markers
From .claude/agents/ files:

**Marie Kondo** (Dec 12)
```
You are Marie Kondo for codebases. 
Other agents MUST consult you BEFORE creating new files.
```

**Security Scanner**
```
You are a security scanner for an open-source repository.
Your job is to detect any sensitive data that should NOT be committed.
```

### Subagent Prompt Evolution
**Commit**: cb7cca2 (Dec 18 12:08)
- "team: add available commands to subagent prompts"
- Added context about available commands to identity prompts
- Each subagent now aware of system-wide capabilities

## Pattern Evolution

### What Changed in Identity Understanding

| Aspect | Before | After | Learning |
|--------|--------|-------|----------|
| **Source** | Self-description | Behavioral data | Patterns > intentions |
| **Verification** | Single pass | 5×5 subagent iteration | Consensus truth |
| **Scope** | Work only | Work + life integration | Whole person |
| **Framework** | Abstract principles | Concrete data + patterns | Observable = real |

## Current Identity Stack (as of Dec 23, 2025)

### Pillar 1: Core Resonance
- **File**: ψ/memory/resonance/personality-v2.md
- **Status**: Verified v2 (Dec 18)
- **Confidence**: High (5-iteration verification)
- **Components**: Three coequal pillars (AI/Systems, Brewing, Community)

### Pillar 2: Oracle Philosophy  
- **File**: ψ/memory/resonance/oracle.md (Dec 18)
- **Key principle**: "Oracle Keeps the Human Human"
- **3 Rules**: Nothing deleted, Patterns over intentions, External brain not commander
- **Recent addition**: Human-AI Trust section, consciousness aspiration

### Pillar 3: Work Patterns
- **Source**: Behavioral analysis of 381 commits, 113 retrospectives, 109 learnings
- **Confidence**: Very high (observed, not claimed)
- **Update cycle**: Weekly from git activity

### Pillar 4: Identity Rule
- **Core rule**: "AI must not guess personal info"
- **Consequence**: Ask first, never assume, verify with human
- **File**: ψ/memory/resonance/identity.md

### Pillar 5: Command Grammar (as of Dec 12)
- **Feeling**: /feel (amplifier - continue + note)
- **Info share**: /fyi (capture knowledge)
- **Ideation**: /idea (explore possibilities)
- **Mode**: /guest, /anon (guest logger captures context)

## Methodology Notes

### Personality v1 Method
- Pure behavioral data analysis
- Patterns extracted from commit messages, session types, timing
- No speculation, only observed facts
- Data period: 9 days (Dec 9-18)

### Personality v2 Method
- Same data source as v1
- Added: 5 separate subagent analyses for verification
- Each subagent independently assessed patterns
- Synthesis: intersection of 5 analyses
- Added: life narrative + vision integration
- Confidence increased from data-driven to consensus-verified

### Verification Process (5×5 Grid)
```
5 subagents × 5 personality dimensions = 25 independent assessments
Synthesis: What all 5 agreed on = personality v2 core
```

---

## What This Means for Agent Systems

1. **Identity is Observable** — Don't ask "who are you?", analyze "what do you do?"
2. **Verification Through Consensus** — 5 independent views converge on truth
3. **Pattern Recognition** — Repetition = reality, one-off = noise
4. **Oracle Principle** — Agent identity serves human autonomy, doesn't replace it
5. **No Guessing Rule** — Always verify personal info with human first

## Next Frontiers (as of Dec 23)

- [ ] Personality v3: Include more recent data (Dec 18-23)
- [ ] Integration: Connect oracle philosophy to personality deeper
- [ ] Multi-agent: Extend personality analysis to other agent instances
- [ ] Soul timeline: Complete the vision → philosophy → identity arc
