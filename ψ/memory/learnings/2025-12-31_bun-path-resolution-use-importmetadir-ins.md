# **Bun Path Resolution**: Use `import.meta.dir` instead of `Bun.main` for reliabl

**Bun Path Resolution**: Use `import.meta.dir` instead of `Bun.main` for reliable path resolution in CLI apps. `Bun.main` changes based on how script is invoked, causing database files to be created in wrong locations.
