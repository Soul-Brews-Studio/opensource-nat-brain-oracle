# React state management: Start with useState/useReducer for local state. Use Cont

React state management: Start with useState/useReducer for local state. Use Context for shared state that doesn't change often (theme, auth). Use Zustand or Jotai for simple global state. Use Redux/Redux Toolkit for complex state with many reducers. Colocate state as close to usage as possible. Avoid prop drilling with composition first, then context.
