> "Patterns Over Intentions" — Oracle Philosophy

## Analysis Period: Dec 9-14, 2025

First week of serious AI collaboration with Claude Code.

## Daily Breakdown

| Date | Working Window | Sessions | Hours | Focus |
|------|----------------|----------|-------|-------|
| 12/09 | 11:00-23:06 | 12 | ~12h | Oracle Foundation, Headline, Cellar |
| 12/10 | afternoon | 3 | ~2.5h | Light (Discord, hooks) |
| 12/11 | — | — | 0 | Day off |
| 12/12 | afternoon | 1 | ~0.5h | Minimal |
| 12/13 | 09:40-23:42 | 13 | ~14h | MAW architecture marathon |
| 12/13-14 | overnight | continuous | 19+h | Command inheritance discovery |

## Summary Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Hours** | ~48h (6 days) |
| **Average (all days)** | ~8h/day |
| **Average (intensive days)** | 10-14h/day |
| **Longest Session** | 13.5h |
| **Total Commits** | 260+ |
| **Total Retrospectives** | 30+ |

## Patterns Observed

### 1. Bimodal Work Style
Either **intense** (12-14h) or **light** (<3h). No middle ground.

```
Intense days: 12/09, 12/13
Light days: 12/10, 12/12
Off: 12/11
```

### 2. Working Window
Typical: **09:00 - 24:00** (15h window)

Peak hours:
- Morning: 09:00-10:00
- Afternoon: 14:00-17:00
- Evening: 20:00-24:00

### 3. Session Length Distribution

| Type | Duration | Frequency |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Micro | 10-30 min | Common |
| Focus | 2-4 hours | Very common |
| Marathon | 8-14 hours | Peak days |

### 4. Overnight Sessions
Happened on:
- 12/09 (until 23:06)
- 12/13-14 (19+ hours continuous)

Pattern: Major breakthroughs often happen overnight.

### 5. AI Collaboration Style
- Constant throughout sessions
- Multiple parallel agents common
- Haiku for bulk work, Opus for synthesis
- 7:1 Haiku:Opus ratio optimal

---

## Insights

### What Triggers Intense Days?
- New architecture (Oracle, MAW)
- Discovery mode (overnight exploration)
- Deadline pressure (pitch prep)

### What Triggers Light Days?
- Post-intense recovery
- Maintenance tasks only
- External commitments

### Energy Management
- Deep focus requires 3-4h uninterrupted
- Recovery day after marathon essential
- Evening = peak creativity window

---

## For Future Reference

When planning work:
- **Expect** bimodal pattern, don't fight it
- **Schedule** intense work on days without commitments
- **Allow** recovery days after marathons
- **Protect** evening hours for deep work

When AI collaboration:
- Parallel agents = speed
- Overnight = discovery
- Morning = review and polish
