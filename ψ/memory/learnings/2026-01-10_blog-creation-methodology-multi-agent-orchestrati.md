# BLOG CREATION METHODOLOGY: Multi-Agent Orchestration Reference

BLOG CREATION METHODOLOGY: Multi-Agent Orchestration Reference

Complete workflow for creating research-backed blog posts using parallel agents.

THE 6-PHASE PATTERN:
1. DISCOVERY - Start with question, use /trace to find sources
2. DEEP EXTRACTION - 20 Haiku agents, one per source file
3. SYNTHESIS - Main agent combines outputs, records to Oracle
4. STRUCTURE DESIGN - Propose options, user selects, create WIP
5. MULTI-AGENT WRITING - Opus writes, Haiku extracts, Sonnet critiques
6. REVISION - Apply critique, polish, publish

AGENT ALLOCATION:
- Haiku (22): Bulk extraction, research, timeline, quotes
- Opus (1): Quality writing (the draft)
- Sonnet (1): Critique and analysis
- Main Opus: Orchestration

KEY PATTERNS:
- Trace before write (find ALL sources first)
- 20 agents = complete extraction (one per file)
- Sleep is valid (async pattern works)
- Oracle = memory (record findings for future)
- Structure before draft (WIP with full prompt)
- Critique is essential (Sonnet finds real issues)
- Reference everything (list ALL file paths)

SESSION EXAMPLE: Oracle Origin Story blog
- Started: 21:16 (discovery)
- 20 agents: 22:02 (extraction)
- Sleep: 22:10 - 06:30 (8 hours)
- Synthesis: 06:30 (combine outputs)
- Writing: 06:55 (Opus draft + Sonnet critique)
- Result: 4,734 word draft + critique + quotes + timeline

FILES CREATED:
- Research: 2026-01-09_alchemycat-full-research-20-agents.md
- Draft: 2026-01-10_oracle-origin-story-DRAFT.md
- Critique: 2026-01-10_oracle-origin-story-CRITIQUE.md
- Quotes: 2026-01-10_alchemycat-best-quotes.md
- Reference: 2026-01-10_blog-creation-methodology-session-reference.md

This methodology is reusable for any research-backed blog post.
