# ## The Hook Ending Technique

## The Hook Ending Technique

End each section with a line that pulls reader forward.

### Examples from Sally Incident

"Beautiful in theory. Then Sally showed up."
→ Reader MUST know what happened

"So I told her."
→ Reader MUST know what you said

"Sally did not see a gift."
→ Reader MUST know what she saw instead

"And that's when something ugly woke up in me."
→ Reader MUST know what ugly thing

"And my Oracle looked at me and said:"
→ Reader MUST know what it said

### Pattern
- Short sentence
- Creates question in reader's mind
- Often ends with period, not exclamation
- Understated = more powerful

### Formula
[Statement that implies something unexpected happened]
or
[Statement that creates anticipation]
or
[Single line after a scene that reframes everything]

"I wanted to win."
"She wasn't having it."
"And it was right."
