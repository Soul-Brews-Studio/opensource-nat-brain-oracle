# Pineapple Hefeweizen Part 2 - Flamin Galah Brewing Co

## Video Summary & Timestamps

- **[01:00]** Finishing the wort transfer and graining out (spending the grain for cattle feed)
- **[02:26]** Cleaning the HERMS (Heat Exchange Recirculating Mash System)
- **[03:41]** The Boil: Adding salts and Saaz hops
- **[04:22]** Quality Control: Monitoring pH (aiming for 5.2) and gravity
- **[06:55]** pH Correction: Using calcium carbonate and citric acid to hit the 5.2–5.3 range
- **[08:08]** Whirlpool: 15-minute stand to precipitate proteins and trub
- **[08:41]** Transfer to Fermenter: Using the heat exchanger and oxygenating the wort
- **[11:36]** Pitching Yeast: Using SafAle T-58
- **[12:30]** Post-Fermentation: Dumping the yeast cone after 12 days
- **[14:49]** Fruit Addition: Preparing and adding 90kg (initial dose) of pineapple puree
- **[19:25]** Carbonation: Setting head pressure to 12 PSI for 3.2 volumes of CO2
- **[21:55]** Final Adjustments: Doubling the fruit dose to 180kg for a stronger profile

## Key Brewing Techniques

1. **HERMS Cleaning**: Running hot liquor backwards through the system to ensure no residue remains
2. **pH Management**: Meticulous adjustment using citric acid and calcium carbonate to ~5.2
3. **Rice Hulls**: Used in mash to prevent stuck mash with high-wheat recipes
4. **Whirlpool Dynamics**: Using low pressure in center to collect trub while pulling clear wort from side
5. **Carbonation Calculation**: 3.2 volumes of CO2 using 5.4g per liter

## Recipe Details

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Hops | Saaz (Single addition for 10 IBU) |
| Yeast | SafAle T-58 (peppery/spicy esters) |
| Fruit | 180kg total Pineapple Puree (doubled from 90kg) |
| Target Gravity | 1.047 (Final: 1.046.8) |
| Target pH | 5.2 |
| Style | Hefeweizen |

## 3 Main Takeaways

1. **Iterative Tasting is Crucial**: Originally planned 90kg pineapple, doubled to 180kg when aroma was "muted"
2. **Oxygen Management (DO Testing)**: Test dissolved oxygen before adding fruit - dump if >50 ppb
3. **Ferulic Acid Rest Advantage**: Specific mash rest produces massive clove and banana flavors
