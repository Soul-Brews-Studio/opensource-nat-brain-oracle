# Discovery Learning Pedagogy for Psychology

Discovery Learning Pedagogy for Psychology

**Core Principle**: "Pain → Discovery → Retention"

**Traditional vs Discovery Teaching**:
| Traditional | Discovery |
|-------------|-----------|
| "Here's the theory" | Build first, hit wall |
| "This technique helps" | Experience the problem |
| Forgotten in weeks | Retained for years |

**The Emotional Arc** (compress months into days):
1. Build/experience → excitement
2. Use it → success
3. Hit the wall → concern
4. Crisis moment → despair
5. AHA MOMENT → discovery
6. Recovery → deep understanding

**For Psychology Curriculum**:
- Don't teach "defense mechanisms" as lecture
- Have students experience psychological distress
- Let them discover defense mechanisms as THEIR solution
- Students feel the problem before discovering theory

**Key Quote**:
"The best teachers don't teach the answer. They engineer the question."

**Implementation**: Case-study-first pedagogy
1. Work with realistic psychological scenarios
2. Experience confusion/complexity personally
3. Discover theories as solutions to observations
4. Creates lasting retention vs memorization
