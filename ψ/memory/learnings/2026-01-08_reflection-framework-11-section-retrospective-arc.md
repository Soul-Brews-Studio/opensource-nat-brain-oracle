# Reflection Framework: 11-Section Retrospective Architecture

Reflection Framework: 11-Section Retrospective Architecture

**The Retrospective Template**:
| Section | Psychology Application |
|---------|----------------------|
| AI Diary (150+ words) | Vulnerable first-person narrative |
| What Went Well | Strengths identification |
| What Could Improve | Session-specific feedback |
| Honest Feedback | 3-point friction capture |
| Co-Creation Map | Human-AI contribution assessment |
| Intent vs Interpretation | Misalignment detection |
| Communication Dynamics | Clarity, trust calibration |
| Blockers & Resolutions | Problem-solving evidence |
| Resonance Moments | Meaning-making |
| Seeds Planted | Future ideation |
| Teaching Moments | Pattern distillation |

**Key Feature**: 
3-point adversarial check forces genuine reflection vs. surface positivity

**Knowledge Distillation Flow**:
```
Live Session → Retrospective → Logs → Learnings → Resonance (Soul)
```
Each layer removes noise, extracts signal.

**80% Ready for Psychology**:
✅ Vulnerability in journaling
✅ Structured gap detection
✅ Adversarial truth-seeking
✅ Bilingual emotional expression

**Needs Psychology-Specific Layering**:
- Clinical safety guardrails
- Standardized metrics (PHQ-9)
- Therapeutic modality protocols
