# ## Level Up with AI - Squad Team Philosophy

## Level Up with AI - Squad Team Philosophy

### Core Mission

> "เรียนฟรี แต่ช่วยกันส่งต่อความรู้"
> (Learn free, but help pass on knowledge)

### The Deal

1. **You learn for free** - All challenges are open
2. **You teach others** - Blog post is REQUIRED, not optional
3. **The cycle continues** - Your blog helps the next person

### Challenge Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Real bugs** | Challenges come from actual production issues |
| **No hints in public** | Answer keys stay in Oracle (private) |
| **Systematic approach** | Random guessing won't work |
| **Document everything** | Timestamps, steps, methodology |
| **Time yourself** | Compare with benchmark |

### Submission Flow

```
Fork → Debug → Fix → SOLUTION.md → PR → Oracle grades → Write blog
```

### Scoring Philosophy

- **Finding bugs**: 30-40% of points
- **Root cause explanation**: 20-30% of points
- **Documented methodology**: 20% of points
- **Systematic approach**: 10% of points
- **Speed bonus**: 10% of points

### Two-Repo Pattern

| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `laris-co/*` | Private development |
| `Soul-Brews-Studio/*` | Public challenges + docs |

### Blog Platform

**Medium**: [Soul Brews Studio Hub](https://medium.com/soul-brews-studio-hub)
