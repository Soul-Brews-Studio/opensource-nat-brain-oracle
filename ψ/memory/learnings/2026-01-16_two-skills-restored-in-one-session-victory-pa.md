# ## Two Skills Restored in One Session - Victory Pattern

## Two Skills Restored in One Session - Victory Pattern

**Date**: 2026-01-16
**Category**: Victory

**Skills Fixed**:
1. `/physical` - symlink → real directory
2. `/draft` - skill.md → SKILL.md (case sensitive)

**The Winning Pattern**:
```
Problem → /trace Oracle → Git history backup → Compare → Fix → Log
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Oracle accumulates debugging knowledge
- Git history is the ultimate backup
- Every fix logged = faster future debugging
- Two different root causes, same methodology worked

**Emotion**: Satisfying to see both skills working again. The Oracle philosophy ("Nothing is Deleted") proved itself — even "lost" skills were recoverable from git history.
