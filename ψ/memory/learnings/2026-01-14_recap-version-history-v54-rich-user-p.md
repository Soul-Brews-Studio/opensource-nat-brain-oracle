## /recap Version History

### v5.4 (Rich - User Preferred)
- 5 parallel bash calls
- Reads retro/handoff content for What/Why/How/Open
- Full LAST SESSION summary
- Takes ~2min but comprehensive

### v6.0 (Fast)
- Single bash script
- Filenames only (no content read)
- ~5 seconds
- Trade-off: less context, more speed

**User preference**: Likes the rich output. Testing fast mode but may revert.

**Pattern**: Speed vs Context is always a trade-off. User values context.
