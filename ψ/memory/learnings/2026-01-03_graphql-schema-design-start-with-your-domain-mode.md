# GraphQL schema design: Start with your domain model, not REST endpoints. Use nul

GraphQL schema design: Start with your domain model, not REST endpoints. Use nullable fields by default, make non-null explicit. Design mutations around user actions, not CRUD. Use interfaces for shared fields, unions for polymorphic returns. Version via schema evolution, not URL versioning.
