# **Comparison: Old vs New Approach**

**Comparison: Old vs New Approach**

Old (before MCP tools):
- Manual grep through files for patterns
- Write handoffs as markdown manually
- Re-read CLAUDE.md for guidance
- Learnings scattered in retrospectives

New (with MCP tools):
- oracle_search for semantic pattern finding
- handoff via MCP tools (when connected)
- oracle_consult for decisions (use simple queries)
- oracle_learn captures patterns immediately

Key difference: Old was file-based, new is query-based. Both work, new is faster for retrieval.
