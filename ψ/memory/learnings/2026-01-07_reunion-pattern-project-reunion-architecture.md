# ## Reunion Pattern: /project reunion Architecture (Corrected)

## Reunion Pattern: /project reunion Architecture (Corrected)

**Metaphor**: Reunion = reconnect, catch up, share learnings, remember when we met

NOT "vampire drain" — that's cold. Reunion is warm. 🤝

### Flow
```
/project reunion [slug]

1. CONNECT     → ghq get/pull (go meet the project)
2. LINK        → symlink to ψ/learn/repo/ (connect)
3. TALK        → Oracle reads ψ/memory/*.md (catch up, listen)
4. UPDATE      → oracle_learn new content (note what we learned)
5. INDEX       → Add to central Oracle (save memories)
6. NOTE        → Update last_reunion timestamp (remember when we met)
7. UNLINK      → Optional offload (don't have to stay together always)
```

### Why "Reunion" Not "Vampire"
- Reunion = warm, collaborative, sharing
- Vampire = cold, extractive, one-sided
- Projects that graduate are like friends who moved away — reunion brings them back to share stories

### The Pattern Name
🤝 **Reunion Pattern** — Connect, Talk, Update, Index, Note
