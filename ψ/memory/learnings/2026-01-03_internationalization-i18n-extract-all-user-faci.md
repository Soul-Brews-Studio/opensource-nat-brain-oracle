# Internationalization (i18n): Extract all user-facing strings from code into reso

Internationalization (i18n): Extract all user-facing strings from code into resource files. Use ICU message format for plurals and gender. Store translations in JSON keyed by locale. Load translations lazily per-locale. Use libraries like react-intl or i18next. Consider RTL layouts for Arabic/Hebrew. Test with pseudolocalization.
