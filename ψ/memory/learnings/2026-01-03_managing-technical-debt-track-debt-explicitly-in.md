# Managing technical debt: Track debt explicitly in issues/backlog - don't let it 

Managing technical debt: Track debt explicitly in issues/backlog - don't let it become invisible. Allocate 10-20% of sprint capacity for debt reduction. Refactor alongside feature work when touching related code. Prioritize debt that slows development or causes bugs. Write tests before refactoring legacy code. Document why shortcuts were taken.
