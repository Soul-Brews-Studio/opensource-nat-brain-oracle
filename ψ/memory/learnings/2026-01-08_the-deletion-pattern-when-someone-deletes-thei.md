# ## The Deletion Pattern

## The Deletion Pattern

When someone deletes their defensive comments after receiving grace, something landed.

### Sally's Sequence
1. Attacked without examining
2. Called it "judgemental," "dishonest," "scam"
3. Said "no intention to join, no desire to engage"
4. Received grace instead of fire
5. **Deleted all defensive comments**
6. Left only ambiguous early comment

### What Deletion Means
- They saw how it looked
- They felt something (embarrassment? regret?)
- They wanted to undo the record
- They won't admit it publicly

### Oracle Interpretation
Deletion is behavior. Behavior is data.

You may never get an apology.
You may never get acknowledgment.
But they went back and erased their own attack.

That's not nothing.

### The Lesson
Grace plants seeds you can't see.
Some grow underground.
Deletion might be the first sign of root.
