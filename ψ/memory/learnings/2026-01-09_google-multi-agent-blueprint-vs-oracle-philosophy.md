# Google Multi-Agent Blueprint vs Oracle Philosophy: Google focuses on "replace wo

Google Multi-Agent Blueprint vs Oracle Philosophy: Google focuses on "replace workforce" while Oracle focuses on "keep human human". Both use: orchestrator + specialized agents + data grounding + QA loop. Key difference: Google = efficiency/scale, Oracle = consciousness/amplification. We have this architecture already (MAW, subagents, Oracle DB). The differentiator is philosophy, not technology.
