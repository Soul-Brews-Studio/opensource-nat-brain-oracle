# Design system architecture: Follow atomic design (atoms → molecules → organisms 

Design system architecture: Follow atomic design (atoms → molecules → organisms → templates). Define design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) as CSS variables or JS constants. Build components in isolation with Storybook. Document props and usage examples. Version the component library separately. Use composition over configuration for flexibility.
