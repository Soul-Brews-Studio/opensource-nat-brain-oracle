# Test doubles (mocks, stubs, spies): Use stubs for simple return values, mocks fo

Test doubles (mocks, stubs, spies): Use stubs for simple return values, mocks for behavior verification, spies for tracking calls. Prefer dependency injection over module mocking. Don't mock what you don't own - wrap third-party APIs. Reset mocks between tests. Over-mocking makes tests brittle - mock at boundaries only.
