# Course Folder Reorganization Proposal (Jan 11, 2026)

Course Folder Reorganization Proposal (Jan 11, 2026)

PROPOSED STRUCTURE:
```
courses/
├── flagship/     ← v2 ready (205 slides)
├── legacy/       ← v1 reference
├── platforms/    ← skilllane
├── custom/       ← client workshops
├── free/         ← lead gen funnel
└── delivered/    ← still live, not archive!
```

KEY INSIGHT: "delivered" not "archive" — nothing is dead, all reference material stays live.

NAMING: ALL CAPS for index files (WORKSHOP-CATALOG.md, GENEALOGY.md) matches CLAUDE.md pattern.
