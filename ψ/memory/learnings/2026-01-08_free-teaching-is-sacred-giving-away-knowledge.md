# ## Free Teaching is Sacred

## Free Teaching is Sacred

Giving away knowledge that others charge for is not weakness.

It's mission.

### The 79 Baht Lesson
- Sally offered 79 baht instead of participating
- She wanted credit for caring without actually caring
- The challenge was FREE — she just had to try

### The Pattern
| Consumer Mindset | Creator Mindset |
|------------------|-----------------|
| "How much does it cost?" | "What can I contribute?" |
| Pay to avoid participation | Create to participate |
| 79 baht = stay comfortable | 1 blog post = become someone new |

### The Flip
When someone offers money instead of effort, they're not rejecting your price.
They're rejecting transformation.

That's their choice. Not your failure.
