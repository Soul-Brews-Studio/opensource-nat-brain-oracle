# CORS configuration: Whitelist specific origins, never use wildcard (*) with cred

CORS configuration: Whitelist specific origins, never use wildcard (*) with credentials. Handle preflight OPTIONS requests properly. Set Access-Control-Max-Age to cache preflight responses. Expose only necessary headers. For APIs, consider using same-origin with API proxy instead of CORS.
