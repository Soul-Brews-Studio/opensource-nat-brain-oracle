# Monorepo with pnpm workspaces: Use pnpm for faster installs and strict dependenc

Monorepo with pnpm workspaces: Use pnpm for faster installs and strict dependency isolation. Structure as packages/ for shared libs, apps/ for deployables. Use turborepo or nx for build caching and task orchestration. Define workspace protocol (workspace:*) for internal deps. Keep root package.json minimal - scripts only.
