# 🍺 Brewing Day = dual meaning

🍺 Brewing Day = dual meaning

1. **Literal**: Day of actual beer brewing (mash, boil, ferment)
2. **Metaphor**: Rest day where ideas "ferment" in the mind

Detection in /hours command:
- Sleep gap > 15 hours = 🍺 Brewing day
- After actual brew day, subsequent rest days = also brewing (waiting for fermentation)

Pattern: High intensity work → Brewing day → Ideas settle → Better output

"Brewing" captures the essence: you're not idle, you're fermenting.
