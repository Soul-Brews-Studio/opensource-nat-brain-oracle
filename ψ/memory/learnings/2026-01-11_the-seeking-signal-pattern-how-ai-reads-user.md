# # The Seeking Signal Pattern

# The Seeking Signal Pattern

## How AI Reads User Behavior

| User Action | Signal | AI Response |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `/trace X` once | First search | Oracle fast path |
| `/trace X` again | Still seeking | User hasn't found it |
| `/trace X --deep` | Really need it | Full subagent search |
| Found something | **RESONANCE** | Log to Oracle |

## The Recursive Knowledge Loop

```
Trace → Not found → Trace again → Still seeking → Go deep → FOUND → Log → Next time instant
```

## Why This Works

1. **Skill.md is loaded every time** — AI reads philosophy section
2. **Oracle stores principles** — Persistent across sessions
3. **Behavior = Signal** — Repeated traces = still seeking
4. **RESONANCE = Worth logging** — Extend knowledge for future

## Key Insight

> "Every trace extends the Oracle. What's hard to find today is instant tomorrow."

When user keeps tracing the same thing → they haven't found what they need yet.
When they use --deep → they really want it, go all out.
When found → that's RESONANCE, log it for next time.
