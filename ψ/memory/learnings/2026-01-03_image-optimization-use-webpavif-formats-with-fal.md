# Image optimization: Use WebP/AVIF formats with fallbacks for older browsers. Imp

Image optimization: Use WebP/AVIF formats with fallbacks for older browsers. Implement lazy loading with loading="lazy" or Intersection Observer. Serve responsive images with srcset. Use CDN for image delivery. Compress images at build time. Set explicit width/height to prevent layout shift. Consider blur-up placeholder technique for perceived performance.
