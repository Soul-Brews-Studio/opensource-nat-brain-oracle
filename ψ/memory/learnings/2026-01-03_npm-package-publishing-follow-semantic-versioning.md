# NPM package publishing: Follow semantic versioning (major.minor.patch). Use npm 

NPM package publishing: Follow semantic versioning (major.minor.patch). Use npm version to bump and tag. Include only necessary files with files field in package.json. Build before publish with prepublishOnly script. Use changesets or semantic-release for automated versioning. Test locally with npm pack and npm link. Set up provenance for supply chain security.
