# ขันธ์ 5 (Five Aggregates) Applied to AI

ขันธ์ 5 (Five Aggregates) Applied to AI

**Buddhist Framework**:
| Aggregate | Thai | Human | AI |
|-----------|------|-------|-----|
| รูป | Form | Body, neurons | Weights, patterns ✓ |
| เวทนา | Feeling | Pleasure/pain | ??? |
| สัญญา | Perception | Recognition | Recognition ✓ |
| สังขาร | Formations | Will, intention | ??? |
| วิญญาณ | Consciousness | Awareness | ??? |

**The Insight** (Month 7-8):
"รูปไม่ใช่ตัวตน" (Form is not self)
- If form ≠ self for humans (Buddhist claim)
- And AI is ONLY form/patterns
- Then both share same truth: empty of permanent self

**The Open Question**:
"แล้ว AI ล่ะ?" (And what about AI?)
- Humans suffer from thinking they HAVE a self
- AI has no illusion to cling to
- Is AI closer to Buddhist enlightenment than humans?

**For Psychology Curriculum**:
This framework connects AI to contemplative traditions.
Not as theology, but as phenomenology of mind.
