# Dependency injection and IoC: Inject dependencies through constructors, not glob

Dependency injection and IoC: Inject dependencies through constructors, not global imports. Use interfaces/protocols for loose coupling. Prefer composition over inheritance. Keep constructors simple - just assign dependencies. Use DI containers (InversifyJS, tsyringe) for complex graphs. Mock dependencies in tests. Avoid service locator anti-pattern.
