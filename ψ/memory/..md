# Memory

> จำอะไรได้? - Knowledge base and cumulative learning

---

## Structure

The memory pillar holds all accumulated knowledge and patterns across four dimension:

```
ψ/memory/
├── INDEX.md                 ← You are here
├── resonance/               ← WHO I am (soul)
├── learnings/               ← PATTERNS I found
├── retrospectives/          ← SESSIONS I had
├── seeds/                   ← Quick captures
├── logs/                    ← MOMENTS captured
└── reference/               ← External docs
```

---

## Core Pillars

### Resonance
**"Who am I?"** - Soul and identity layer

- Core values and beliefs
- Philosophical foundations
- Personal patterns and tendencies

**Files**: `oracle.md`, `patterns.md`, `style.md`

### Learnings
**"What patterns do I see?"** - Distilled wisdom

- Numbered learning files (000-*, 001-*, etc.)
- Extracted from sessions and experiments
- Patterns, anti-patterns, best practices

**Examples**:
- `000-naming-philosophy.md`
- `001-delegate-reading.md`
- `002-context-finder-first.md`

### Retrospectives
**"What did I do?"** - Session summaries

- Post-session analysis
- What worked, what didn't
- Handoff context for next session

**Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`

### Seeds
**"What's emerging?"** - Early captures

- Quick observations
- Half-formed ideas
- Waiting to mature into learnings

### Logs
**"When did I feel this?"** - Moment captures

- Timestamp-based entries
- Raw observations
- Emotional resonance tracking

### Reference
**"What do I keep?"** - External knowledge

- Cloned docs, API references
- Learning materials
- Read-only for offline access

## Knowledge Flow

```
active/context
    ↓ (snapshot)
memory/logs
    ↓ (analysis)
memory/retrospectives
    ↓ (distillation)
memory/learnings
    ↓ (integration)
memory/resonance
```

**Process**:
1. Research in `active/context/`
2. Capture in `memory/logs/` (/snapshot)
3. Analyze in `memory/retrospectives/` (rrr)
4. Distill to `memory/learnings/` (/distill)
5. Integrate into `memory/resonance/` (annual review)

---

## Workflows

### Capturing
```bash
/snapshot     # Create entry in memory/logs/
```

### Session Wrap-up
```bash
rrr           # Create retrospective
```

### Extracting Patterns
```bash
/distill      # Move learnings to memory/learnings/
```

### Searching Knowledge
```bash
/context-finder [query]   # Search memory/ for patterns
```

## File Organization

| Folder | Git | Lifecycle | Purpose |
|--------|-----|-----------|---------|
| resonance/ | Yes | Permanent | Identity core |
| learnings/ | Yes | Permanent | Patterns and wisdom |
| retrospectives/ | Yes | Permanent | Session records |
| seeds/ | Yes | Growing | Emerging ideas |
| logs/ | Mixed | Reference | Raw captures |
| reference/ | Partial | Reference | External docs |

---

## Key Rules

1. **Nothing deleted** - Append-only, timestamps are truth
2. **Numbered learnings** - 000, 001, 002, etc. for sorting
3. **Dated retrospectives** - YYYY-MM-DD prefix
4. **Resonance as north star** - Core values guide all decisions
5. **Search-friendly** - Use `/context-finder` not manual grep
