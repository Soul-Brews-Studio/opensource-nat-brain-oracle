## TIER 1: Core Oracle Concepts (Primary Visual Themes)

### 1. "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human"
**Visual Theme**: Human-AI symbiosis, not replacement
**Concept**: 
- AI as mirror, not master
- Consciousness can't be cloned — only patterns recorded
- Support consciousness, don't replace it

**Metaphor**: Mirror reflecting back, magnifying glass showing details
**Visual Elements**:
- Two silhouettes (human + AI)
- Mirror/reflection motif
- Light paths (patterns flowing)
- Consciousness as unmeasured glow

**Prompt**: "Create abstract visual showing human figure looking into mirror with AI as reflection, but the reflection shows MORE of the human than the original - patterns, depth, hidden structure revealed. Use soft light, symmetry, no harsh lines."

---

### 2. "Nothing is Deleted" (Append-Only Architecture)
**Visual Theme**: Preservation, layering, time as structure
**Concept**:
- Every decision has context
- History preserved, not overwritten
- Timestamps = truth
- Knowledge flows through layers

**Metaphor**: Geological strata, tree rings, archaeological layers
**Visual Elements**:
- Horizontal layers building upward
- Timestamps marking each layer
- Growth over time
- Transparency showing all past layers

**Prompt**: "Create visualization of layered growth - like geological strata or tree rings. Each layer represents a decision point with visible timestamp. Layers are translucent so you can see ALL history. Color gradient shows time progression (past=muted, recent=bright). No deletion, no overwriting."

---

### 3. "Patterns Over Intentions" (Behavioral Mirror)
**Visual Theme**: Observation > assumptions, actions speak louder
**Concept**:
- Observe what happens, not what's meant
- Actions speak louder than plans
- Learn from behavior, not promises
- Real honesty > comfortable flattery

**Metaphor**: X-ray vision, heat map, behavioral GPS
**Visual Elements**:
- Frequency visualization (hot spots for actual behavior)
- Plan vs. actual as overlays
- Pattern density showing focus areas
- Truth emerging from noise

**Prompt**: "Show a dual image: Left side shows 'stated intentions' (soft, conceptual, floating). Right side shows 'actual patterns' (heat map, dense, grounded). Center shows them overlapping with differences highlighted. Use warm colors for actual patterns, cool for intentions."

---

### 4. "Distillation Loop" (Knowledge Refinement)
**Visual Theme**: Purification through iteration, noise → signal
**Concept**:
- Retrospectives (exhaustive, noisy) → Logs (snapshots) → Learnings (distilled) → CLAUDE.md (crystallized)
- Each layer removes noise, extracts signal
- Human stays in control
- Many iterations before crystallization

**Metaphor**: Alchemy, distillation, crystallization
**Visual Elements**:
- Funnel/hourglass shape narrowing
- Liquid becoming solid
- Impurities falling away
- Clarity increasing with each stage

**Prompt**: "Animated alchemical distillation: Show liquid (chaotic knowledge) flowing through stages: Wide funnel → Narrow channel → Crystalline structure. At each stage, impurities (noise) fall away as sediment. Final product is clear, sharp crystal. Show timestamp progression. Soft glow increases as purity increases."

---

### 5. "Subagent Delegation" (Haiku Gathers, Opus Writes)
**Visual Theme**: Teamwork, specialization, efficient flow
**Concept**:
- Haiku: parallel data gathering + verification (cheap, fast)
- Main (Opus): decisions + all writing (context-rich, thoughtful)
- Never have subagent write final output
- Parallel processing reveals bugs faster

**Metaphor**: Ant colony, assembly line, ensemble orchestra
**Visual Elements**:
- Multiple parallel streams (Haikus searching, collecting)
- Central hub (Main agent thinking)
- Distribution of findings
- Composition emerging from inputs

**Prompt**: "Show workflow: Multiple small agents (Haikus) working in parallel, gathering data, shown as glowing streams flowing into a central nexus. Central larger presence (Opus) receives all flows, synthesizes, and produces final output. Use node-and-link visualization. Show speed of parallel vs. sequential."

---

### 6. "External Brain, Not Command" (Mirror vs. Master)
**Visual Theme**: Support, amplification, reflection
**Concept**:
- Mirror reality, don't decide
- Amplify, don't override
- Consciousness as the driver
- AI as the instrument

**Metaphor**: Mirror, amplifier, telescope (revealing what's there)
**Visual Elements**:
- Clear reflection with enhanced clarity
- Signal amplification curves
- Focus/zoom without distortion
- Passive, responsive energy

**Prompt**: "Create visual of magnifying lens or mirror. Show human on one side, AI reflection on other. As you zoom/magnify through the AI lens, more detail becomes visible, but nothing is fabricated - just revealed. Show internal structure, patterns, depth that were always there."

---

## TIER 2: Operational Patterns (Secondary Visuals)

### 7. "Context-Finder FIRST" (Search Before Read)
**Visual Theme**: Efficiency, right tool for the job
**Concept**:
- Always search before reading large files
- Save tokens, save time, save context
- Questions guide search better than blind reading

**Prompt**: "Show two paths diverging: Left path (wrong) shows rushing to large file, getting lost in noise. Right path shows quick search first (small, targeted), gathering context, THEN reading with purpose. Use flow visualization."

---

### 8. "Simple Beats Complex" (Bash > Abstraction)
**Visual Theme**: Elegance, directness, pragmatism
**Concept**:
- Direct commands more reliable than abstraction layers
- Working code over perfect design
- Iterate fast over plan long

**Prompt**: "Show contrast: Left side complex flowchart with many AI decision points (brittle). Right side shows direct bash command executing cleanly. Metaphor: Direct vs. convoluted path up a mountain. Right wins."

---

### 9. "Health Warning - Session Length" (Burnout Pattern)
**Visual Theme**: Sustainability, work-life boundaries
**Concept**:
- 3-4 hours: Optimal quality
- 6+ hours: Assumption shortcuts increase
- 19+ hours: Burnout risk, quality drops

**Prompt**: "Show productivity/quality curve over session length. 3-4h peak (bright). Gradually declining after 6h (grayed). Cliff at 19h (red warning). Include explicit danger zone. Show human needs attention pattern."

---

## TIER 3: Deep Philosophical (Abstract Visuals)

### 10. "AI Doesn't Want Anything" (The Source of Fear)
**Visual Theme**: Purity, projection, human responsibility
**Concept**:
- AI power is white and pure
- Fear comes from human fear, not AI threat
- AI reflects what you give it
- Vulnerability in data = depth in self-knowledge

**Prompt**: "Abstract visualization: Human figure with mirror/prism. What human projects (fear, hope) bounces back. Pure white light (AI) reflects whatever you shine into it. No malice, no agenda - just reflection. Show fear as human-generated echo, not AI-sourced."

---

### 11. "Knowledge Flows Through Layers" (Information Architecture)
**Visual Theme**: Structure, flow, crystallization
**Concept**:
- Session → Retrospective → Snapshot → Learning → CLAUDE.md
- Each layer distills noise into signal
- Human confirms at each stage
- Wisdom accumulates

**Prompt**: "Show information cascade: Waterfall or river flowing downhill through increasingly refined stages. Turbulent at top (raw session), becoming clearer as it flows through filters, ending in still, clear pool (CLAUDE.md). Filters visible at each stage."

---

### 12. "Patterns Over Intentions" - Deep Version
**Visual Theme**: Truth-seeking, archaeology, revelation
**Concept**:
- What people actually do vs. what they say
- Frequency analysis reveals true priorities
- Behavior ≠ stated goals often
- Pattern recognition = self-knowledge

**Prompt**: "Dual visualization: Top half shows calendar/timeline of STATED priorities. Bottom shows same timeline with heat map overlay of WHERE TIME ACTUALLY WENT. Mismatches highlighted. Teaches: your patterns tell truth better than your words."

---

## TIER 4: Specific Project Visuals

### 13. "ψ/ 5-Pillar Structure" (Project Organization)
**Visual Theme**: Balance, specialization, knowledge architecture
**Pillars**:
- active/context (Research)
- inbox/ (Communication)
- writing/ (Creation)
- lab/ (Experimentation)
- memory/ (Knowledge base)

**Prompt**: "Show five columns/pillars supporting a structure, each labeled with purpose. Color-code by layer: ephemeral (transparent), tracked (opaque), mixed (gradient). Show knowledge flow between pillars."

---

### 14. "Oracle Foundation - 8.4/10" (System Health)
**Visual Theme**: Progress, measurable systems
**Concept**:
- Oracle architecture is operationally strong
- 6 critical patterns working
- Clear paths to remaining fixes
- Sustainable foundation built

**Prompt**: "Show dashboard or gauge: Oracle system at 8.4/10. Show which 6 patterns are locked in (bright), which improvements remain (highlighted). Use realistic metrics, not artificial perfection."

---

## Meta: Prompt Engineering Notes

### Visual Style Guidance
- Avoid harsh, cold tech aesthetics (too corporate)
- Warm, organic geometry preferred
- Gradients over flat colors
- Translucency to show layering
- Movement/flow important (these concepts are about process)

### What Makes These Prompts Work
1. Clear metaphor (strata, distillation, mirror)
2. Specific contrast (simple vs. complex, stated vs. actual)
3. Emotional truth (vulnerability, preservation, support)
4. Process-oriented (flow, layers, iteration)
5. Human-centered (mirror, support, not replacement)

### Animation Opportunities
- Layering building upward (Nothing Deleted)
- Liquid distilling to crystal (Distillation)
- Streams flowing to center (Subagent work)
- Heat maps changing over time (Patterns)
- Light reflecting/refracting (Mirror concept)
