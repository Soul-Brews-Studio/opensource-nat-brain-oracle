# Plugin Marketplace & Identity Philosophy

**Time**: 08:46 GMT+7

## What We Learned

- **Marketplace needs top-level manifest**: `plugins/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` required to register as marketplace, not just individual plugin.json files
- **hooks.json requires wrapper**: Must have `{"hooks": {...}}` structure, not hooks directly at root level
- **Branding split makes sense**: `nat-*` for personal identity, `catlab-*` for generic tools
- **File naming convention**: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM_filename.md` allows chronological sorting across days
- **Identity transfer paradox**: Building tools to transfer identity reveals identity was never fixed

## How Things Connect

- **Plugin structure → Marketplace**: Individual plugins have plugin.json, but parent folder needs marketplace.json to be installable
- **nat-data-personal → Oracle/Shadow**: Personal knowledge plugin carries philosophy that can be forked
- **Forkability → Non-attachment**: Making "self" copyable = practicing letting go of "self"
- **Tech singularity → Ego dissolution**: The convergence point may be where tech and dharma meet

## Key Discoveries

- `claude plugin validate` catches structural issues before install
- `claude plugin marketplace add [path]` registers local plugin directories
- hooks.json schema validation error message shows exact path: `"path": ["hooks"]`
- Git commit timestamps can backfill file naming via `git log -1 --format="%ai"`

## Raw Thoughts

- "The best part is no part" connects to Buddhist non-self
- ยิ่งสร้าง tools ถ่ายโอนตัวตน → ยิ่งเห็นว่าตัวตนไม่เคยมีจริง
- 3 versions of philosophy summary saved - none perfect, each has value
- Subagent delegation working well for routine tasks (rename, etc.)
- Voice notify plugin needs separate catlab-voice repo eventually
