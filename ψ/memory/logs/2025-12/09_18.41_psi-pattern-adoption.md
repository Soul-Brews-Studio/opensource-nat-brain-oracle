# ψ Pattern Adoption

**Time**: 18:41 GMT+7

## What We Learned

- Weyermann's ψ prefix = "psyche" (จิตวิญญาณของโปรเจค)
- The prefix is less important than the **structure patterns**
- Knowledge hierarchy: Retrospectives → Logs → Learnings (exhaustive → distilled)
- README.md in each folder ensures format consistency
- Numbered learnings (001-, 002-) indicate critical incidents

## How Things Connect

- **Weyermann → Our Patterns**: Borrowed structure, skipped ψ prefix
- **Folder = Scope**: Domain folders organize by type of knowledge
- **Filename = Identity**: Time + slug makes files scannable
- **Day as Folder**: Enables "what happened on day X?" navigation

## Key Discoveries

- ψ evolved from real problems (force push incident, cleanup mistakes)
- Good structure comes from pain, not theory
- Don't over-engineer — add structure when needed

## What We Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `learnings/README.md` | Format guide for distilled wisdom |
| `logs/README.md` | Format guide for snapshots |
| `retrospectives/README.md` | Format guide for session analysis |
| `learnings/000-naming-philosophy.md` | Meta: why we name things this way |

## Raw Thoughts

- The ψ prefix is elegant but unnecessary for us
- What matters is the thinking behind it, not the symbol
- "Folder = scope, filename = identity" is a powerful mental model
- Should apply this pattern to future folders (ideas/, context/, etc.)
