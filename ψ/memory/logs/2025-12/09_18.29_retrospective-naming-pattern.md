# Retrospective Naming Pattern

**Time**: 18:29 GMT+7

## What We Learned

- Weyermann uses `YYYY-MM/DD/HH.MM_descriptive-slug.md` for retrospectives
- Day as **folder**, not filename prefix — cleaner organization
- Descriptive slugs derived from Primary Focus field
- Time prefix enables automatic chronological sorting

## How Things Connect

- **Weyermann → Our Pattern**: Cloned repo in `.tmp/` serves as reference for best practices
- **Descriptive filenames → Scanability**: Can understand session content without opening file
- **Folder-per-day → Timeline navigation**: Easy to see what happened each day

## Key Discoveries

- Original pattern `09_18.19.md` combines day+time in filename — messy
- Better: `09/18.19_cellar.md` — day is folder, time+topic is filename
- This matches how humans think: "What did I do on the 9th?" → open folder → see all sessions

## Commits

- `70957a0` refactor: retrospectives use YYYY-MM/DD/HH.MM_slug.md structure
- `efc2bcc` refactor: retrospective filenames must be descriptive

## Raw Thoughts

- Could apply same pattern to logs/ folder?
- Weyermann uses ψ prefix for meta folders — we don't (simpler)
- The pattern is really about: folder = scope, filename = identity
