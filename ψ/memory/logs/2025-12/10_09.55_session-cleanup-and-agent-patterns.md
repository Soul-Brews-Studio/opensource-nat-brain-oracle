# Session Cleanup & Agent Patterns

**Time**: 09:55 GMT+7

## What We Learned

- **Commands vs Agents**: Commands = prompt templates (user invokes), Agents = specialists (auto-delegate)
- **repo-auditor should be Agent only**: No need for command, Claude auto-delegates
- **Proactive agents**: Like security-scanner, repo-auditor should warn BEFORE commits
- **new-feature template matters**: Comprehensive template = comprehensive issues
- **Good conversation pattern**: Note side info → return to main task

## How Things Connect

- **HEADLINE data bloat → repo-auditor need**: Real incident proves proactive scanning needed
- **Plugin architecture → repo cleanliness**: Without plugins, projects dump files into main repo
- **new-feature quality → Issue #5 vs #4**: Better template → better issue structure
- **Subagent delegation → efficiency**: Use Haiku for routine tasks, Opus stays focused

## Key Discoveries

- **Issue quality depends on agent template**: #3 (detailed) vs #4 (short) showed template matters
- **File naming convention**: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM_filename.md` prevents collision
- **gitignore strategy**: `__pycache__/`, `.agent-locks/` should always be ignored
- **scratch/ folder**: Good place for temp/working files not for git

## Commits
- `ae772e4` docs: session context, retrospective, and shared context patterns
- `7c845c8` feat: repo-auditor agent + improved new-feature template

## Raw Thoughts

- repo-auditor Issue #5 now comprehensive (closed #4, recreated)
- Sleep data: ~7hrs (00:30→07:50) - noted for pattern tracking
- Friend asked about multi-agent context → created shared-context docs
- UV_WORKFLOW files moved to scratch/ - cleanup complete
- Session productive: 3 commits, 1 new agent, 1 improved template
