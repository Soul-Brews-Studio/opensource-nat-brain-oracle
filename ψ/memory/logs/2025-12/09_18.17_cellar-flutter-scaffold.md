# Cellar Flutter Scaffold

**Time**: 18:17 GMT+7

## What We Learned

- Flutter macOS requires full Xcode (not just Command Line Tools)
- `flutter create --platforms macos` creates macOS-only project
- System tray packages (`tray_manager`, `window_manager`) are native-only — no web support
- CocoaPods required for Flutter macOS dependencies

## How Things Connect

- **Cellar → Voice Bridge**: Cellar is storage backbone, Voice Bridge feeds transcriptions in
- **Cellar → claude-voice-notify**: Cellar stores data, voice-notify handles output/alerts
- **Incubation pattern**: Keep in parent repo with .gitignore, graduate to own repo when ready

## Key Discoveries

- Flutter 3.38.4 stable installs via `brew install flutter`
- Web platform must be explicitly added (`flutter create . --platforms web`)
- Native-only focus means we skip web entirely — system tray is core feature
- "Butter" was speech-to-text mishearing of "Flutter"

## Architecture Decision

```
Native Only (no web)
├── System tray = core feature
├── SQLite = local storage
└── macOS first → Windows/Linux later
```

## Raw Thoughts

- Name "Cellar" works well — brewing metaphor, underground storage, aging over time
- Use case still TBD: Claude Code logger vs voice transcripts vs unified brain
- Could become the "local memory layer" for all Nat's agent tools
- Next: decide primary use case, design SQLite schema, prototype tray icon
