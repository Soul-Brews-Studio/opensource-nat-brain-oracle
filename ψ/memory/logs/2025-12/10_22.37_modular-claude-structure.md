# Modular CLAUDE Documentation Structure

**Time**: 22:37 GMT+7

## What We Learned

- **Template lives in repo**: `.tmp/weyermann-malt-productpage/` contains the full modular CLAUDE structure - no need to search externally
- **6-file modular structure**: CLAUDE.md as lean hub, 5 specialized files for safety/workflows/subagents/lessons/templates
- **"When to Read" priority system**: 🔴 Required (every session), 🟡 As needed, 🟢 Reference
- **Pre-save validation checklist**: Forces quality by requiring blank-filling before save

## How Things Connect

- **Weyermann → Nat's Agents**: Same structure, different content. Project-specific rules (Oracle Philosophy, file access rules) go in CLAUDE.md hub
- **CLAUDE_lessons.md ↔ ψ-learnings/**: CLAUDE_lessons.md is quick reference, ψ-learnings/ is detailed distillation
- **CLAUDE_templates.md → rrr command**: Template in docs, command uses template to generate retrospectives
- **Modular docs → Navigation**: Each file has navigation bar linking to all others

## Key Discoveries

- **ψ-context/ should be tracked**: "Nothing is deleted" principle - working context is valuable history
- **Retrospective validation checklist**: Tags, Linked Issues, Commits, AI Diary word count - prevents incomplete docs
- **Model Selection Guide pattern**: Table showing which model (haiku/opus) for which task type - helps token efficiency

## Commits

- `6be2269` fix: track ψ-context/ and ψ-drafts/ (not ignored)
- `c417c52` refactor: adopt modular CLAUDE documentation structure

## Tags

`claude-md` `modular-docs` `weyermann-template` `oracle-philosophy` `documentation-structure`

## Raw Thoughts

- The workshop project (000-workshop-product-page) also has this structure - two sources of truth?
- Should CLAUDE_lessons.md be auto-updated from ψ-learnings/?
- Pre-save validation could be enforced by hook?
- Navigation bar in every file is redundant but useful for quick jumps
