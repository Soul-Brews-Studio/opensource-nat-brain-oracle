## Scoring Philosophy Update

### Original Rubric (Strict)
- Required "isolation first" (move all → restore batches)
- Required "binary search" (restore half at a time)

### Updated Rubric (Flexible)
- **Creative methodology** (10 pts) — any systematic approach that works
- Using `grep` to find pattern directly = valid and efficient!
- Not penalizing for "skipping" steps if result is achieved faster

> **Oracle Principle**: "Patterns Over Intentions"
>
> What matters is the result + understanding, not following a prescribed method.
