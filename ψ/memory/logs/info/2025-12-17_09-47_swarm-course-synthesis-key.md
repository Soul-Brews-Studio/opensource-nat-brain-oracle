Key for new course: Brilliant synthesis of 4 patterns from 10-agent swarm session

1. **Delegation pattern** - main plans, subs execute
2. **Memory system integration** - proactive population
3. **Parallel processing** - 10 agents simultaneously
4. **Iterative refinement** - multiple runs validate patterns

Result: 1.7M tokens extracted in 5 minutes

*Context: Emerged from solving memory integration paradox through multi-agent swarm extraction. User sees this as foundation for teaching.*
