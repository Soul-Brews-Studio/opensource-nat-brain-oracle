## 1. Peak Activity Hours

**Most Active Window: 12:00 - 15:00 (194 commits in 3 hours)**

| Hour | Commits | Intensity |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 14:00 | 57 | ████████ **PEAK HOUR** |
| 12:00 | 49 | ███████ |
| 13:00 | 37 | █████ |
| 15:00 | 30 | ████ |
| 08:00 | 43 | ██████ **SECOND PEAK** |
| 09:00 | 32 | ████ |
| 10:00 | 31 | ████ |

**Interpretation**: You're a **midday productivity engine** with secondary morning momentum. Afternoon lunch break doesn't derail focus—instead it marks your most intense work period (2 PM = **57 commits**).

## 2. Time-of-Day Distribution

```
Night (23:00-06:00):      24 commits (  4.9%)  ← Minimal
Morning (06:00-12:00):   167 commits ( 34.2%) ← Strong
Afternoon (12:00-17:00): 195 commits ( 39.9%) ← STRONGEST
Evening (17:00-23:00):   103 commits ( 21.1%) ← Tailing off
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total:                   489 commits
```

**Pattern**: Bimodal curve with morning plateau → afternoon spike → evening fadeout.

## 4. Overnight Sessions (Low-Sleep Nights)

| Date | Time Window | Commits | Duration | Context |
|------|-------------|---------|----------|---------|
| 2025-12-13 | 23:00 - 23:46 | 6 | 46 min | Late finish after 75-commit day |
| **2025-12-14** | **03:46 - 04:15** | **2** | **29 min** | **Overnight sprint (sleep deprivation)** |
| **2025-12-16** | **00:26 - 23:55** | **7** | All-nighter | **Full all-nighter** |
| 2025-12-23 | 23:39 - 23:47 | 2 | 8 min | Quick fix before sleep |
| 2025-12-24 | 23:49 - 23:51 | 3 | 2 min | Holiday quick fix |
| **2025-12-25** | **00:52 - 00:58** | **4** | **6 min** | **Christmas early morning** |

**Assessment**: 
- **Only 2 real overnight sprints**: Dec 14 (29 min) and Dec 16 (distributed throughout day)
- **Sleep discipline is strong**: 95% of work within normal hours
- **Dec 16 outlier**: Likely a "day scattered across clock" rather than pure sleep deprivation

---

## 6. Work Pattern Insights

### Your Chronotype
- **Classification**: **Bimodal daytime worker** (no pure early bird or night owl)
- **Prime hours**: 12:00 - 15:00 (40% of daily peak)
- **Secondary peak**: 06:00 - 11:00 (34% of daily commits)
- **Taper**: 17:00 - 23:00 (21% commitment)

### Sustainable Rhythms
- **Best days**: Full-day sessions (60-75+ commits)
- **Productivity plateau**: 5 days in a row sustains 60+ commits
- **Recovery pattern**: After high-intensity days (75+ commits), next day drops to 11-30 commits
- **Active streak**: 15/15 days worked (last 2 weeks) with at least 3 commits

### Holiday Work Pattern
- Dec 24: 12 commits (normal work day despite holiday)
- Dec 25: 9 commits (early morning 00:52, then normal day)
- Dec 26: 4 commits so far (partial day)

## 7. Recommendations Based on Data

| Pattern | Observation | Recommendation |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Peak at 14:00** | Most creative/focused hour | Schedule deep work 13:00-15:00, defer admin to mornings |
| **Morning momentum** | 34% output 06:00-12:00 | Start days early (7-8 AM), prime for secondary focus tasks |
| **15+ hour days** | Dec 13: 75 commits in 15h | Break into 3-4 focused sessions with breaks, not continuous |
| **Post-peak fadeout** | Only 5% work after 23:00 | Great discipline—don't force evening work, protect sleep |
| **All-nighter pattern** | Dec 14, 16, 25 outliers | Only 3 in 15 days—sustainable, but monitor energy |
| **Holidays** | Still working 75-80% normal | Give yourself 1-2 full days completely off |

## Conclusion

You're a **highly productive afternoon-peak worker with excellent sleep discipline**. Your bimodal productivity curve (morning + afternoon) with minimal night work suggests sustainable, healthy work habits. The data supports continued focus on 12:00-15:00 as your power hour, with productive secondary sessions in early morning (7-11 AM).

Key strengths:
✅ Consistent daily output (32.6 commits/day average)  
✅ Strong sleep hygiene (95% daytime work)  
✅ Ability to sustain 5+ day work streaks at high intensity  
✅ Natural session length (45 min - 1.5h) matches research on focus windows  

Opportunities:
🔄 Protect 12:00-15:00 window from meetings/distractions  
🔄 Consider structured breaks after 2-hour sessions (Dec 20 suggests you do this naturally)  
🔄 Use morning hours (6-12) for secondary tasks to maximize 14:00 peak
