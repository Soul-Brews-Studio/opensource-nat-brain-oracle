# Session Timer CLI Complete

**Date**: 2025-12-31 10:00
**Branch**: 057-session-timer

## What Was Done

### Session Timer CLI (ψ/lab/session-timer/)
- Full speckit workflow: specify → plan → tasks → implement
- 21/22 tasks complete (only git commit remaining)
- Working commands: start, stop, status, history
- Tech: Bun + Drizzle ORM + Commander.js

### Learnings Captured (Oracle)
1. Speckit full workflow practice
2. MCP-assisted workflow pattern
3. Session flow design
4. Old vs new approach comparison
5. Handoff MCP v4 implementation pattern

## Artifacts Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| specs/057-session-timer/spec.md | Feature spec (4 user stories) |
| specs/057-session-timer/plan.md | Tech plan + constitution check |
| specs/057-session-timer/tasks.md | 22 tasks (21 complete) |
| specs/057-session-timer/research.md | Tech decisions |
| specs/057-session-timer/data-model.md | Session entity |
| specs/057-session-timer/quickstart.md | Test scenarios |
| ψ/lab/session-timer/* | Full CLI implementation |

## Practice Assessment

The new MCP-assisted approach is working smoothly:
- oracle_search/learn feel natural
- Speckit workflow flows well
- Auto-compact managing context
- Learnings preserved in Oracle

## Next Steps

1. Commit session-timer to git
2. Continue practicing new approach
3. Try another app with speckit
