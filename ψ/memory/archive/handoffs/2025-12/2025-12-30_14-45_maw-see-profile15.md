## Done This Session

- [x] Created `maw see` command for viewing agent output
- [x] Added client detection (Claude/Codex/Gemini/Shell)
- [x] Added quick client check: `maw see -c`
- [x] Created profile15 (all Claude dangerous mode)
- [x] Committed and pushed all changes

## Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.agents/scripts/see.sh` | New - view agent tmux output |
| `.agents/maw.env.sh` | Added `maw see` command |
| `.agents/profiles/profile15.sh` | New - all Claude dangerous mode |

## Commands Added

```bash
maw see        # All agents, 10 lines each
maw see 1      # Agent 1, 20 lines
maw see 1 50   # Agent 1, 50 lines
maw see -c     # Quick client check
```

## Profile 15 Usage

```bash
maw start profile15   # All agents = Claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

## Commits

- `e64734d` feat(maw): Add maw see command for viewing agent output
- `1cc88d2` feat(maw): Add client detection to maw see
- `a2dd50e` feat(maw): Add quick client check flag

## Next Steps

1. [ ] **IMPORTANT**: Update `start-agents.sh` to read AI_CLIENT and AGENT_N_CLIENT variables from profile
2. [ ] Test profile15 with `maw start profile15`
3. [ ] Verify all 5 agents start as Claude

## Implementation Needed

`start-agents.sh` currently hardcodes which client to start. Need to add:

```bash
# After sourcing profile
if [[ -n "${AI_CLIENT:-}" ]]; then
  # Use profile's AI_CLIENT for all agents
fi

# Per-agent override
AGENT_CLIENT="${AGENT_${i}_CLIENT:-$AI_CLIENT}"
AGENT_FLAGS="${AGENT_${i}_FLAGS:-$AI_FLAGS}"
```

## Key Learnings

- `maw see` uses tmux capture-pane under the hood
- Client detection based on output patterns (opus/sonnet/context left/etc)
- Profile variables may need integration in start-agents.sh
