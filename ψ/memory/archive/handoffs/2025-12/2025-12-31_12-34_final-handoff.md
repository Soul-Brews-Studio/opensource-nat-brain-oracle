# Final Session Handoff

## Session Summary

1. **Built 14 CLIs** (065-078) - pattern documented
2. **Fixed Ralph loop** - was in `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md`
3. **Debated /trace vs /trace-v2** - decision pending

## CLIs Built (all complete except 078)

065-077 complete, 078-slug WIP (needs package.json update)

## /trace Debate Result

**Proposal**: Cherry-pick 4 features from v2 into v1, then archive v2

| Add to v1 | Skip |
|-----------|------|
| --simple flag | Two-round architecture |
| Confidence badges | Caching |
| Visual timeline | Auto-learn slugs |
| Error handling | Fuzzy matching |

**Next action**: Update .claude/commands/trace.md with 4 features

## Pending Decision

User asked about `/debate` command update - may want to review/customize.

## Git Status

- All pushed to origin
- No uncommitted changes

## To Continue

```bash
git pull origin main

# Option 1: Finish 078-slug
cd ψ/lab/slug
# Update package.json, test, commit

# Option 2: Update /trace with 4 features
# Edit .claude/commands/trace.md
```
