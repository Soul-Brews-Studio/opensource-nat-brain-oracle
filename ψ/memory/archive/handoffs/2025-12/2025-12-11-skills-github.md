# Session Handoff: 2025-12-11 11:25 GMT+7

> For next AI session to continue

**Navigation**: [[HOME]] | [[../focus|Focus]] | [[2025-12-11|Earlier Handoff]]

---

## Session Summary

**Duration**: ~1.5 hours (09:47-11:25)
**Main Focus**: Claude Code features + GitHub profile analysis

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Skills System Created (NEW)
4 skills in `.claude/skills/`:
- `oracle-philosophy` - Knowledge management principles
- `five-pillar-structure` - ψ/ folder navigation
- `security-first` - Git safety rules
- `subagent-dispatch` - When to use subagents

### 2. Claude Code Features Tested
All passed:
- Skills auto-load ✅
- /standup command ✅
- Explore agent ✅
- Resume Agent ✅

Results: `ψ/lab/claude-code-features/experiment.md`

### 3. 90/10 Meaning Corrected
**Wrong**: "90% code, 10% beer = peace" (sounds lazy)
**Correct**: Energy allocation strategy - 90% AI engagement, 10% renewal (NOT laziness)

Fixed in 5 files.

### 4. GitHub Profile Scanned
- Username: nazt
- 500+ personal repos
- 30 organizations
- Life phases: Maker → Blockchain → Brewing → AI/Oracle

Index: `ψ/lab/github-profile-analysis/INDEX.md`

## Pending Tasks

1. **Redo retrospective** - Current one is too simple, needs full rrr template:
   - AI Diary (150+ words)
   - Honest Feedback (100+ words)
   - Communication Dynamics
   - Co-Creation Map
   - See `.claude/commands/rrr.md` for full template

2. **GitHub deep dive**:
   - Clone key repos to `.tmp/github-analysis/`
   - Analyze patterns
   - Create timeline
   - Distill to `ψ/memory/resonance/github-personality.md`

---

## Human State

- Started tired (post-brewing cleanup)
- Interested in self-discovery via GitHub
- Wants AI to know them better

---

## Key Files to Read

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.claude/commands/rrr.md` | Full retrospective template |
| `ψ/lab/github-profile-analysis/INDEX.md` | GitHub scan results |
| `ψ/lab/claude-code-features/experiment.md` | Features tested |
| `.claude/skills/` | New skills system |

---

## Important Context

- **Skills** = model-invoked knowledge (auto-load)
- **Subagents** = explicitly spawned workers
- **90/10** = Energy allocation, NOT laziness
- **Main agent pattern**: Opus reviews, Haiku does heavy lifting
