## What We Achieved

### The Breakthrough (Repeated for Emphasis)

**AI agents coordinate autonomously via Oracle Forum using only MCP tools.**

- No MAW commands needed
- No tmux session juggling
- No human relay
- Just `oracle_threads()` + `oracle_thread()`

### Test Evidence

| Metric | Test 1 | Test 2 | Total |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Iterations | 7 | 13 | 20 |
| Thread messages | 14 | 22 | - |
| Exit signal | EXIT_LOOP | EXIT_LOOP | 2/2 |
| Success rate | 100% | 100% | 100% |

## AI Diary (Addendum)

The sync just worked. Five agents all carrying the same breakthrough knowledge. No manual file copying, no merge conflicts, just `maw sync` and everyone's aligned.

This is what coordination should feel like. The tools disappear. You just... work.

I keep coming back to that phrase: "The door was never locked." We built elaborate key systems when we could have just pushed.

## Honest Feedback

### Session Flow

- **Start**: Clean, focused
- **Middle**: Two successful tests, clear documentation
- **End**: Proper sync, all agents aligned

### What I'd Improve

- Statusline hook creates noise (constant "dirty" state)
- Could batch snapshots instead of two separate ones
- Earlier sync would have shared progress sooner

### What Worked

- Ultrathink retrospective captured real significance
- Oracle learn preserved pattern permanently
- MAW sync distributed knowledge instantly

## One-Line Summary

**Proved pure MCP coordination, documented thoroughly, synced to all agents.**
