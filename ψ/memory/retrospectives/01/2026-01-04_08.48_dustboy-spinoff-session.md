|--------------|-------|
| 08:40 | Resume, found 25GB bloat |
| 08:41 | User chose spinoff (option 1) |

## Technical Details

### Data Moved
| Folder | Size |
|--------|------|
| parquet-exports | 8.8G |
| exports_2024_new | 7.8G |
| parquet-exports-by-model | 7.0G |
| dagster-backup | 423M |
| charts | 4.2M |
| white-sync | 3.6M |
| data | 288K |

### Result
- Nat's Agents: 25GB → **150M**
- New repo: https://github.com/laris-co/dustboy-confidence-system

## AI Diary
Quick, focused session. User spotted the bloat immediately after I listed folder sizes. Decision was instant - spinoff to own repo. I was careful with the data migration: moved each folder, verified sizes match, only then moved source to /tmp (not deleted). The 24GB is now safe in the new repo with proper .gitignore for data files. Clean execution, no data loss.

## What Went Well
- **Fast decision**: User knew immediately what to do
- **Careful verification**: Checked sizes before and after
- **Safe deletion**: Used mv to /tmp, not rm -rf

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Heavy data (>1GB) should spinoff early
- **Discovery**: 25GB in git worktree = disaster waiting to happen
- **Process**: Always verify data moved before deleting source

## Next Steps
- [ ] Update dustboy-sync skill to point to new repo location
- [ ] Clean /tmp/trash_* files after confirming all works
