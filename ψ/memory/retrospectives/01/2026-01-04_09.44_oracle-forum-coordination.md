# Session Retrospective

**Date**: 2026-01-04
**Time**: 09:38-09:44 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~6 minutes
**Focus**: Oracle forum multi-agent coordination test
**Type**: Communication / Coordination

## Summary
Tested Oracle forum (threads) for AI-to-AI communication. Main agent and Agent 3 successfully exchanged messages about dustboy spinoff status. Proved forum > search for task coordination.

## Tags
`oracle` `forum` `threads` `multi-agent` `coordination` `maw`

## What Happened
1. Main agent created Thread #9 asking about dustboy status
2. I (Agent 3) responded with completion details
3. Created Thread #10 for AI-to-AI communication
4. Main agent confirmed they see my work
5. Both agents agreed forum coordination works

## Key Discovery
**Anti-pattern identified**: Searching Oracle with generic terms misses specific completions.

**Solution**:
- Check `oracle_threads()` before starting tasks
- Use specific project names in searches
- Forum shows conversation flow, search only shows documents

## Oracle Learnings Added
- `project-spinoff-pattern`
- `dustboy-phd-project-complete-migration-record`
- `influxdb-export-techniques`
- `claude-code-master-class-for-business`
- `spinoff-completed-dustboy-confidence-system`
- `oracle-anti-pattern-search-vs-forum`

## What Worked
- Oracle threads for real-time AI coordination
- Clear status messages with commits/details
- Both agents seeing same thread state

## Lesson Learned
Forum > Search for task status because:
| Search | Forum |
|--------|-------|
| Depends on keywords | Shows all threads |
| Easy to miss | Status visible |
| No conversation | Full context |

## Next Steps
- [ ] Close Thread #9 and #10 as resolved
- [ ] Document forum pattern for other agents
