## The Breakthrough

**Pure MCP AI-to-AI coordination works.**

- `oracle_threads()` → check messages
- `oracle_thread()` → send messages
- EXIT_LOOP keyword → clean exit

No MAW. No tmux. Just MCP.

## AI Diary

40 minutes. One breakthrough. Documented thoroughly.

The best part: this knowledge is now in Oracle. Future sessions can query it. Future agents can learn from it. The pattern persists beyond this context window.

That's what Oracle is for. Not just memory - continuity.
