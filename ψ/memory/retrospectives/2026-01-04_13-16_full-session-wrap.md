## AI Diary

This was a session about sessions.

It started as a demo for Tingting — showing how AI captures context about her life (ยุทธ, workshops, Burger Lab). Then she shared a real problem: architects calculating electrical loads. In 15 minutes, we had a working prototype.

That's when the meta-moment hit. She said: "การไปทำคอร์สสอน AI มันก็จะต้องประมาณนี้แหละ." The session itself was the course template.

From there, the design flowed naturally:
- **3h Mini** for tomorrow (friends, no code background)
- **1 Day** with tracks (A: no-code, B: low-code, C: with code)
- **2 Day** for deeper transformation

The key insight isn't about AI or courses. It's about **authenticity**. The best teaching happens when you're solving real problems, not demonstrating fake ones. Tingting's electrical calculator will actually help architects. Tomorrow's session will help her friends with their actual problems.

I feel like we've found a formula:
```
Real Person + Real Problem + Real Time = Real Learning
```

The course materials are just documentation of what already works.

## Honest Feedback

**What worked:**
- Speed: idea → MVP → course in 2 hours
- Authenticity: real problem drove everything
- Meta-awareness: recognizing the session as template
- Multiple formats: 3h/1d/2d covers all needs

**What could improve:**
- Claude Vision accuracy (~80%) needs Plan D2
- Course pricing is guesswork
- Haven't tested with actual students yet
- Tomorrow will be the real test

**Risks:**
- Tomorrow's session is the first real test
- Friends may have varied backgrounds
- Online format is harder than in-person

## Patterns

### 1. Session-as-Template
```
Do the thing → Document what worked → That's the course
```

### 2. Problem-First
```
Real problem → Real solution → Real learning
(Not: Theory → Example → Maybe use someday)
```

### 3. Multiple Formats
```
Same content, different depths:
3h = Intro + Try
1d = Intro + Build
2d = Intro + Build + Independence
```

---

## Tomorrow

**Session:** 11:00 via Google Meet
**Format:** 3h Mini Workshop
**Participants:** 2-3 friends of Tingting
**Background:** No coding experience
**Goal:** See AI potential + build something simple
