## AI Diary

Today felt like **graduation day**. The สร้างคน (Building People) concept went from idea to 5 working skills in one session. Issue #2 opened yesterday, closed today.

The migration happened mid-session — we noticed oracle-v2 lived in a lab folder, and fixed it immediately. "Migration while hot" became a pattern.

The /now enhancement came from eating our own dog food. We used /now, noticed the jump philosophy was implicit, made it explicit. Self-reflection → improvement.

## Key Learnings

1. **Issue tracking works**: Plan → Track → Close = satisfying
2. **5 skills = ecosystem**: They compose, not compete
3. **Jump types reveal health**: All sparks/completes = good session
4. **Migration while hot**: Fix tech debt when you see it
