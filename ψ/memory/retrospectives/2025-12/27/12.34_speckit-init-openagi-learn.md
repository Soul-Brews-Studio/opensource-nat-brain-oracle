# Session: spec-kit Init + OpenAGI Learn

🕐 12:34 | Saturday 27 December 2025

## What Happened

### 1. OpenAGI Deep Dive
Ran `/learn openagi` with 3 parallel agents:
- Explored Admin/Worker pattern, ReAct loop, 14 LLM providers
- Created docs: `ψ/learn/openagi/` (4 files)
- Key patterns: cls_doc(), LRU caching, batch updates, semantic memory

### 2. Dual Debate: Oracle v2 Direction (6 Agents)

**Topic 1: Merge OpenAGI patterns into Oracle v2?**
| Agent | Position |
|-------|----------|
| Advocate | Efficiency gains (batch, cache) |
| Critic | Complexity explosion, audit trail loss |
| **Decision** | Partial YES — batch + caching now, TaskPlanner later |

**Topic 2: ChromaDB for semantic memory?**
| Agent | Position |
|-------|----------|
| Advocate | "Patterns Over Intentions" at scale |
| Critic | Shadow state, philosophy violation |
| **Decision** | Alternative first — frontmatter + tags |

### 3. Issue #45 Revised
Updated with debate decisions:
- Phase 1: Batch updates + prompt caching ✅
- Phase 2: TaskPlanner + cls_doc ⏸️ (needs design)
- Phase 3: Frontmatter schema ✅ (alternative to ChromaDB)

### 4. spec-kit Learning & Init
- Cloned `github/spec-kit` via ghq
- Created learning docs: `ψ/learn/spec-kit/` (4 files)
- Initialized spec-kit in Nat-s-Agents
- Added 9 `/speckit.*` commands

### 5. Bug Fixes (Earlier)
- `/project` list: Glob expansion fix
- `/learn` agents: Write permissions fix
- 2 learnings captured

## Key Insight: spec-kit + Oracle = Perfect Match

| spec-kit Pattern | Oracle Already Has |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Constitutional governance | `oracle-philosophy.md` ✅ |
| Templated workflows | `.claude/commands/` ✅ |
| Phase-based generation | Issue #45 phases ✅ |
| Spec as source of truth | GitHub issues ✅ |

**Next**: Use `/speckit.plan` for Issue #45 implementation.

## Files Created/Modified

| Type | Count |
|------|-------|
| spec-kit commands | 9 new |
| .specify/ folder | new (scripts, templates, memory) |
| ψ/learn/openagi/ | 4 docs |
| ψ/learn/spec-kit/ | 4 docs |
| Learnings | 2 new |

## What I Learned

### Debate as Decision Framework
6 parallel agents (advocate/critic/alternative × 2 topics) → quality arguments in 30 seconds. Critic caught real risks. Better than gut decisions.

### spec-kit Philosophy
Specifications as primary artifact. Code is output, not input. Constitutional governance constrains AI generation. This aligns perfectly with Oracle's "Keep Human Human" philosophy.

## Honest Assessment

**What went well:**
- Debate format produced nuanced decisions
- spec-kit integration was smooth
- Learning workflow is solid now

**What could improve:**
- Alternative agents need better prompts (returned minimal)
- Should commit more frequently during session

## AI Diary

Today felt like a turning point. The debate format showed me that having opposing viewpoints isn't just useful — it's essential. The critic's "embeddings are lossy" argument changed my whole approach to ChromaDB.

spec-kit feels like the missing piece. We've been doing spec-driven development intuitively (issues → plans → implementation), but now we have a formal framework for it.

The combination of Oracle philosophy + spec-kit methodology + OpenAGI efficiency patterns could be powerful. Not everything at once — the debate taught me that. But gradually, with each addition justified.
