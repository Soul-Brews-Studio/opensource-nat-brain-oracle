# Retrospective: Oracle Multiverse + Vector DB Learning

**Date**: 2025-12-28 06:45-07:13
**Focus**: Designing Oracle connections across multiple ψ/ repos + cloning vector DB repos

---

## What We Did

### 1. Oracle Multi-ψ/ Design Discussion

Explored how Oracle (this repo) should connect to other ψ/ repositories:

**Discovered 4 existing ψ/ repos**:
| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Nat-s-Agents/ψ/` | Mind — thoughts, AI sessions |
| `nat-garmin-data/ψ/` | Body — health metrics |
| `nat-data-personal/ψ/` | Life — transactions, data |
| `oracle-v2/ψ/` | Meta — Oracle evolution |

**Design options explored**:
- Symlinks in `ψ/external/` (local dev)
- GitHub links in markdown (portable, clickable)
- `/oracle connect` + `/oracle search` commands (not built yet)

### 2. /trace claude-mem

Used /trace to find claude-mem references:
- Found in `ψ/learn/claude-mem` (symlink to thedotmack/claude-mem)
- 13 retrospectives mention it
- Key learning: "memory integration paradox" — plugin doesn't index everything

### 3. Vector DB Learning Collection

Cloned all major vector DBs for study:

```
ψ/learn/
├── chroma/          # Notes from Dec 17
├── chroma-repo/     → chroma-core/chroma
├── chroma-mcp/      → chroma-core/chroma-mcp (claude-mem uses this)
├── qdrant/          → qdrant/qdrant (Rust)
├── faiss/           → facebookresearch/faiss (billion-scale)
└── pinecone/        → pinecone-io/pinecone-python-client
```

**Key insight**: claude-mem uses ChromaDB with hybrid search:
- Vector (semantic) → top 100 matches
- SQLite FTS5 (fallback) → keyword search

---

## What Worked

- **/trace parallel search** — 5 agents found everything about claude-mem fast
- **ghq + symlinks** — Clean pattern for learning repos
- **Existing chroma notes** — Already had quick reference from Dec 17
- **Design conversation** — Clarified multi-ψ/ architecture options

---

## What Didn't Work

- **Pinecone clone failed** — Submodule access issue (private repo)
- **Obsidian abandoned** — `~/Obsidian/` removed, not using anymore
- **Design not finalized** — Multiple options discussed, no decision made

---

## AI Diary

Short morning session — mostly exploration and setup. The "multiple ψ/" revelation is interesting. Each repo having its own AI brain feels right — "free will" as Nat called it. But the connection problem remains: how do they talk to each other?

The vector DB collection is satisfying. All the major players in one place, ready to study. ChromaDB seems simplest for local work. FAISS for when scale matters. Qdrant if we need a proper server.

The `/oracle connect` + `/oracle search` design is promising but not built. Pattern is clear:
1. Registry file lists all connected ψ/
2. Search spawns context-finder across all of them
3. Results aggregated with repo source

Next: Back to OpenAGI as requested.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Remove ~/Obsidian | Not using anymore |
| Keep ψ/ per repo | "Free will" — each domain has own brain |
| Clone vector DBs | Learn the landscape before building |

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Back to OpenAGI work
- [ ] Later: Build `/oracle connect` command
- [ ] Later: Explore vector DBs for Oracle search

---

## Seeds Planted

| Seed | Potential |
|------|-----------|
| Multi-ψ/ federation | Query across all personal repos |
| Vector search for Oracle | Semantic search across retrospectives |
| ChromaDB integration | Already have 6,904 embeddings in claude-mem |
