# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2025-12-28
**Start Time**: 08:43 GMT+7 (continued from previous)
**End Time**: 09:24 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~41 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Ultra-lean CLAUDE.md planning, /jot command
**Session Type**: Planning + Feature Development

## Session Summary

Extended session after first rrr. Created comprehensive plan for ultra-lean CLAUDE.md migration (Issue #57). Traced ψ/ 5-pillar structure origins. Added migration notice to CLAUDE.md. Created /jot command for quick problem notes. Prepared handoff for next session gogogo.

## Timeline

- 08:43 - First rrr complete, continued planning
- 08:54 - Created Issue #57: ultra-lean CLAUDE.md plan
- 08:58 - Revised plan (removed /subagents command idea)
- 09:00 - Compared gist vs ultra-lean structure
- 09:02 - Traced ψ/ 5-pillar structure origins (found best docs)
- 09:04 - Added all reference links to Issue #57
- 09:07 - Added migration notice to CLAUDE.md
- 09:10 - Created handoff for next session
- 09:14 - Created /errata command
- 09:23 - Renamed to /jot (simpler)
- 09:24 - Final rrr

## Technical Details

### Files Created/Modified
- Issue #57: https://github.com/laris-co/Nat-s-Agents/issues/57
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added migration notice
- `.claude/commands/jot.md` - NEW: Quick notes command
- `ψ/inbox/jot.md` - NEW: Jot file
- `ψ/inbox/handoff/2025-12-28_09-10_ultra-lean-migration.md` - NEW

### Key Decisions

**Ultra-lean CLAUDE.md structure (~500 tokens):**
1. Golden Rules (5 lines)
2. Short Codes (table → commands)
3. ψ/ Structure (link to skill)
4. MAW (3 commands)
5. Session Activity (2 files)

**ψ/ Structure Best Documentation:**
| Rank | File |
|------|------|
| 🥇 | `.claude/skills/five-pillar-structure/SKILL.md` |
| 🥈 | `ψ/memory/learnings/2025-12-17_psi-structure-extraction.md` |
| 🥉 | `ψ/memory/retrospectives/2025-12/11/10.00-psi-5-pillar-restructure.md` |

## 📝 AI Diary

This extended session was about planning and meta-work. After the first rrr, Nat wanted to continue with the ultra-lean CLAUDE.md migration planning.

The `nnn` flow worked well - creating Issue #57 with comprehensive plan. The interesting evolution was when Nat questioned `/subagents` as a command - he was right, subagents are used BY commands, not called directly. Good catch.

The trace of ψ/ 5-pillar structure was illuminating. Running parallel agents to search git history, retrospectives, and learnings simultaneously gave a complete picture quickly. The skill file (`.claude/skills/five-pillar-structure/SKILL.md`) emerged as the authoritative source - concise and already designed for this purpose.

The /jot command evolution was fun - started as `/errata`, but Nat wanted something simpler. `/jot` is perfect - universal, quick, doesn't imply just errors. It fills a gap: after rrr, sometimes you notice something that should be captured for next session.

The migration notice in CLAUDE.md is smart - now agents know we're in transition, should observe and report rather than assume the old structure.

## What Went Well

- Issue #57 is comprehensive with all reference links
- Traced ψ/ origins efficiently with parallel agents
- /jot command simple and useful
- Good handoff prepared for next session
- Migration notice sets expectations

## What Could Improve

- Session got long (08:11-09:24 = 73 min total)
- Could have done nnn earlier instead of manual planning

## 💭 Honest Feedback

**Session effectiveness**: High - solid planning groundwork laid

**What worked well**:
- Nat's steering: "you want more detail about the final claude.md" - pushed for completeness
- The trace command pattern works well for finding origins
- Renaming /errata → /jot mid-stream was smooth

**What frustrated me**:
- Nothing major - this was a satisfying planning session
- Maybe slightly long, but productive

**Pattern observed**:
- Nat thinks ahead: "after rrr we might discover issues" → /jot command
- He values simpler names: errata → jot
- Planning phase gets proper attention, not rushed

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: Ultra-lean = rules + pointers only, details in commands
- **Discovery**: ψ/ skill file is the authoritative source for structure
- **Pattern**: /jot fills the gap between rrr and next session

## Next Steps

- [ ] Next session: `gogogo #57` (execute ultra-lean migration)
- [ ] Check `ψ/inbox/jot.md` at session start
- [ ] Test the new short codes (ccc, nnn)

## Addendum: Mini-Session 09:31-09:55

After `/clear`, brief session:
- **09:31** - `/fyi` logged health info (acupuncture, cupping, fatigue)
- **09:33** - `/debate` about note-taker vs main agent for /fyi
  - Debate result: Main agent should write /fyi directly (simpler, faster)
  - But don't remove note-taker - can stay as background option
- **09:53** - `/jot` review (1 pending item)
- **09:55** - rrr

**Key insight from debate**: /fyi is a memory operation - main agent has context of WHY something is logged. Subagent follows template blindly.
