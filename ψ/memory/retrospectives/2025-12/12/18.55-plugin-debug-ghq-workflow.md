# Session Retrospective — 2025-12-12 18:55

## Duration
~1 hour (continued from earlier session)

## What We Did

### 1. /project incubate + learn ✅
- Added two new commands to `/project`
- `incubate [name]` — สร้าง idea file + track as 🌱 Seed
- `learn [name]` — track external project as 🤝 Reunion
- Commit: `8ac2ab2`

### 2. Plugin Debugging (claude-voice-notify) ✅
- Fixed plugin name mismatch (`voice-notify` vs `claude-voice-notify`)
- Fixed source path (`../` → `./`)
- Cleaned old references from 5 config files
- Created learning: `2025-12-12_claude-code-plugin-structure.md`

### 3. ghq Workflow ✅
- Documented ghq as primary repo manager
- `gr` alias for fzf navigation
- Pattern: ghq handles paths → no symlinks needed
- Created learning: `2025-12-12_ghq-workflow.md`

### 4. Traced Local AI Pitch
- Found: Presentation for คุณวิชัย ทองแตง
- Date: 16 ธ.ค. 2568 (Monday)
- Content ready in `ψ/outbox/antigravity-004-slides-local-ai-pitch.md`
- Still need: Export to actual slides (Gamma/Canva)

## Key Learnings

| Config cleanup | When renaming plugin, must clean ALL config files |
| ghq workflow | No symlinks needed — ghq manages paths |
| Oracle lifecycle | External repos track as 🎓 Grad in INDEX.md |
