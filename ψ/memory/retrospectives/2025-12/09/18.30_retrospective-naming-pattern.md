# Session Retrospective

## Session Summary

Short follow-up session to improve retrospective file naming. Learned from Weyermann's pattern that day should be a folder, not filename prefix. Restructured all existing retrospectives and updated /rrr command.

## Timeline

- 18:20 - User pointed out `09_18.19.md` doesn't convey meaning
- 18:22 - Searched Weyermann's ψ-retrospectives for pattern
- 18:24 - Discovered `YYYY-MM/DD/HH.MM_slug.md` structure
- 18:25 - Moved all retrospectives to new structure
- 18:29 - Created snapshot documenting the pattern

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

```
.claude/commands/rrr.md                            | 19 ++++++++--
retrospectives/2025-12/09/11.00_oracle-shadow-init.md (renamed)
retrospectives/2025-12/09/14.15_oracle-weyermann-transfer.md (renamed)
retrospectives/2025-12/09/14.19_oracle-begins.md (renamed)
retrospectives/2025-12/09/16.37_claude-code-plugin.md (renamed)
retrospectives/2025-12/09/18.19_cellar-flutter-scaffold.md (renamed)
```

### Key Code Changes

- **.claude/commands/rrr.md** (+17/-2): Updated structure documentation → ensures future retrospectives follow pattern
- **retrospectives/** (5 renames): Moved to day folders with descriptive slugs → immediate usability improvement

### Architecture Decisions

- **Day as folder**: Matches mental model of "what happened on day X?" → easier navigation
- **Descriptive slugs**: Derived from Primary Focus → scannable without opening file

## AI Diary (REQUIRED - min 150 words)

This was a satisfying micro-session. I assumed the original `09_18.19.md` pattern was acceptable — it had date and time, what more could you need? But when Nat pointed to the Weyermann pattern, I understood immediately: the filename should tell a story without requiring you to open it.

I was confused about the exact Weyermann structure at first — is it `YYYY-MM/DD_HH.MM_slug.md` or `YYYY-MM/DD/HH.MM_slug.md`? The difference is subtle but important. Checking the actual folder structure clarified it: day is a folder, time is filename prefix. This mental model makes sense because you often want to see "what happened today?" before diving into specific sessions.

I expected this would be a simple rename, but it became a pattern documentation opportunity. Updating the /rrr command with examples and the new structure means future Claude instances will follow this pattern automatically. The small investment in documentation pays forward.

What delighted me: Nat teaching by pointing to existing context (Weyermann repo) rather than explaining from scratch. "Go look at what we already have" is more efficient than re-explaining.

## What Went Well

- **Pattern discovery via existing context**: Using Weyermann as reference → faster than designing from scratch → immediate credibility
- **Batch rename**: Did all 5 retrospectives at once → consistent structure immediately → no partial migration

## What Could Improve

- Could have proactively suggested descriptive naming when creating the first retrospective
- The original /rrr command template didn't enforce descriptive names

## Blockers & Resolutions

- **Blocker**: Unsure of exact Weyermann folder structure
  **Resolution**: Checked actual files in `.tmp/weyermann-malt-productpage/ψ-retrospectives/`

## Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - min 100 words)

**What DIDN'T work?** The initial retrospective implementation was incomplete — I created the file and template without thinking about the filename as part of the information architecture. The `/rrr` command focused on content requirements but neglected the most visible part: the filename itself.

**What was FRUSTRATING?** Nothing really — this was a quick, focused improvement. The git add path issue when running from cellar/ subdirectory was minor.

**What DELIGHTED?** The elegance of "folder = scope, filename = identity" as a mental model. Also delightful: batch renaming 5 files with meaningful slugs felt like tidying up a messy desk.

## Co-Creation Map

| Contribution | Human | AI | Together |
|--------------|-------|-----|----------|
| Direction/Vision | ✓ | | |
| Options/Alternatives | | | |
| Final Decision | ✓ | | |
| Execution | | ✓ | |
| Meaning/Naming | | ✓ | |

## Resonance Moments

- **Pointed to** Weyermann context → **I discovered** folder structure → **Mattered** because learning from existing patterns beats inventing new ones

## Intent vs Interpretation

| You Said | I Understood | Gap? | Impact |
|----------|--------------|------|--------|
| "ไฟล์เนมมันไม่บอกความหมาย" | Filenames need descriptive slugs | N | Correct direction |
| "ลองลอกวิธีการจาก Weyermann" | Check their retrospective naming | N | Found exact pattern |

**ADVERSARIAL CHECK**:
1. **Unverified assumption**: "I assumed folder structure from partial path without checking actual files first"
2. **Near-miss**: "I almost used DD_HH.MM instead of DD/HH.MM before verifying"
3. **Over-confidence**: "I was too sure the first retrospective format was fine"

## Communication Dynamics (REQUIRED)

### Clarity

| Direction | Clear? | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| You → Me (instructions) | 95% | "ลอกจาก Weyermann" was precise direction |
| Me → You (explanations) | 90% | Before/after structure comparison was clear |

### Feedback Loop

- **Speed**: Immediate — one exchange to course-correct
- **Recovery**: Smooth — research, implement, verify, commit
- **Pattern**: "Look at existing context" as teaching method works well

### Trust & Initiative

- **Trust level**: Appropriate — let me research and implement
- **Proactivity**: Balanced — executed after clear direction

### What Would Make Next Session Better?

- **You could**: (Nothing — this was efficient)
- **I could**: Proactively suggest descriptive naming when creating new doc types
- **We could**: Document other patterns from Weyermann worth adopting

## Seeds Planted

- **Incremental**: Apply same pattern to logs/ folder → **Trigger**: when logs/ gets cluttered
- **Incremental**: Check other Weyermann folder structures → **Trigger**: next organization decision

## Teaching Moments

- **You → Me**: "Look at existing context before inventing" — discovered when pointed to Weyermann — matters because reference-based learning is faster
- **Us → Future**: Retrospective naming pattern in /rrr — created because original was incomplete — use when creating any retrospective

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: folder = scope, filename = identity — applies to all doc organization
- **Discovery**: Day as folder enables "what happened today?" navigation

## Next Steps

- [ ] Continue with Cellar development
- [ ] Consider applying pattern to other folders (logs/, learnings/)
