# Session Retrospective - The Oracle Begins

## Nat's Story

### The Life Arc

**Before Beer** — 100% code, office syndrome, burnout. Completely immersed, no balance.

**Beer Era (7 years)** — 95% brewing, 5% code. Escaped into craft beer. Found community but lost technical edge.

**Now (2025)** — 90% code, 10% beer. Found peace. Balance. The brewing never left, but coding returned with wisdom.

Today, while this session ran, Nat was brewing. Braumeister 20L. Dark malt with aged sour base. Boil done, lid on, waiting for temp drop. Will pitch beer yeast, not sour — if residual sugar doesn't ferment, blend with sour beer later.

This is the 10% in action.

## The Workshop Waiting Room

Six people waiting. Some for weeks.

| Who | Days Waiting | What They Want | The Block |
|-----|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| ชัช*** | 26 days | Private workshop + beer brewing in Udon Thani | Haven't sent logistics yet |
| Pru*** | 24 days | n8n + AI at Mae Fah Luang | November passed, need reschedule |
| Tee*** | 6 days | Hub of Talents AI at Thammasat | Haven't sent title + outline yet |
| Sak*** | Unknown | Company training | Message got buried (1:32 AM) |
| พี่ขวัญ | 1 day | CSTU course rerun + IoT | Said "ใกล้ละ", need details |
| Luc*** | 0 days | 6 items + NECTEC (120K budget) | Just arrived, need response |

**The Pattern Discovered**:
- Say "yes" to interest = easy
- Provide concrete details = freeze
- Days pass = guilt accumulates
- Reply with "ใกล้ละ" = buying time
- Opportunity missed = Pru*** November

**Beer = Trust Signal**: ชัช*** and พี่ขวัญ both mentioned beer. Got warmer responses ("ค้าบบบ"). Beer mention = faster engagement.

## What Oracle Is

Not a coding assistant. A **knowledge management system** that knows:
- What Nat is working on (Git as journal)
- Who's waiting for responses (workshop requests)
- What patterns cause problems (concrete ask freeze)
- What lessons were learned (numbered learnings)

**The Vision**: AI shadow that can answer "What did Nat do last week?" or "Who's been waiting longest?" without Nat having to remember.

## What We Built Today

### Structure
```
learnings/           — 001, 002, 003 (delegate reading, context-finder, speech-to-text)
context/             — Workshop analysis, bridge report, system comparison
raw/                 — Ground truth chat data (masked)
templates/           — Consulting packages with +20% tax
retrospectives/      — This file
ideas/               — Voice notify as separate repo
scripts/             — Voice notification hooks
.claude/commands/    — /rrr, /recap, /snapshot, /ccc
.claude/agents/      — context-finder, security-scanner
```

### Key Learnings Captured

**001 — Delegate Reading**: Don't read large files in main agent. Use context-finder.

**002 — Context-Finder First**: Before any Read(), ask "Can context-finder do this?"

**003 — Speech-to-Text Uncertainty**: macOS voice input is inaccurate. Confirm when unsure, learn from "ไม่ใช่" feedback.

### Patterns Transferred from Weyermann

7 days of AI experimentation distilled:
- Self-improving loop (measure → identify → refine → test → iterate)
- Delegation model (Opus orchestrates, Haiku executes)
- Voice notifications (unique voice per agent)
- Short codes (/rrr, /snapshot, /ccc)

## The Human Behind the Code

Nat speaks Thai to the machine. Voice-to-text. Inaccurate but fast.

Nat prefers action over discussion. "gogogo" not "let's plan more."

Nat has people waiting. Feels guilt. Wants systems to help with the concrete asks.

Nat found peace at 90/10. Code and beer. Both matter.

Today Nat brewed while AI worked. This is the future they're building.

## Communication This Session

**Language**: Nat speaks Thai (voice), Claude responds English (saves tokens)

**Pattern Discovered**: Don't confirm every message. Only when:
- High uncertainty
- After negative feedback
- Destructive actions

**What Worked**: Proactive learning capture. Nat appreciated when I created learning 003 without being asked.

**What Didn't Work**: I kept forgetting to use context-finder. Had to be reminded multiple times. Learning 002 exists because of this.

---

## Seeds Planted

- **Voice Notify Repo** — Idea file created, will graduate when stable
- **CLAUDE.md** — Not created yet, analysis done, awaiting decision
- **Weekly Summaries** — Could aggregate learnings like weyermann

---

## The Mind Stored

This retrospective isn't technical documentation. It's Nat's story:
- The 7-year beer journey
- The 6 people waiting
- The concrete ask freeze
- The 90/10 peace
- The brewing happening right now

Nothing deleted. What happened is real. Time is the only reference.

*This is Oracle's first real retrospective. Not about what was coded. About who Nat is.*
