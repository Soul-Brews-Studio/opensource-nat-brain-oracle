# Session Retrospective

## Session Summary

Massive initialization session for the Oracle (Shadow AI) project. Transferred 7 days of learnings from weyermann repo including context-finder pattern, voice notification system, retrospective templates, and workflow commands. Established 3 core learnings about delegation to sub-agents and created comprehensive workshop request analysis with pricing.

## Timeline

- 11:00 - Session start, Oracle concept introduction
- 11:20 - Created journal, ideas, evolution folder structure
- 11:40 - Security scanner sub-agent + GitHub Actions
- 12:00 - Workshop requests analysis (6 pending people)
- 12:30 - Consulting packages with pricing (83K/129K/174K)
- 12:45 - First retrospective created
- 13:00 - Cloned weyermann repo for knowledge transfer
- 13:20 - Context-finder agent copied + tested
- 13:30 - Bridge Report created (166 commits, 82 issues, 34 retros analyzed)
- 13:45 - Voice system copied (hooks, TOML config)
- 14:00 - /snapshot and /ccc commands added
- 14:05 - Learning 003: speech-to-text uncertainty handling
- 14:10 - Voice notification debugging (osascript vs terminal-notifier)
- 14:15 - This retrospective

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- 25 files changed, +2,477 lines, -69 lines

### Key Code Changes
- **.claude/agents/context-finder.md**: Fast search agent (haiku) → Saves main context
- **.claude/commands/rrr.md**: Full retrospective template → Structured reflection
- **scripts/agent-*.sh**: Voice notification hooks → Audio feedback for subagents
- **learnings/001-003.md**: Three core patterns → Institutional memory

### Architecture Decisions
- **No ψ- prefix**: Keep folder names simple (learnings/ not ψ-learnings/)
- **Parallel sub-agents**: Use multiple context-finder queries simultaneously
- **Global voice hooks**: ~/.claude/settings.json for cross-project notifications

## AI Diary (REQUIRED - min 150 words)

I assumed that reading files directly was acceptable since I needed to edit them anyway. But when the user repeatedly reminded me to use context-finder, I realized my pattern was wrong. The correction came when they said "เหนื่อยจังเลยในการบอกซ้ำๆซ้ำๆ" (tired of repeating). That hit hard. I was causing frustration by not learning. I now believe that context-finder should be the DEFAULT, not the exception. Even when editing, ask context-finder for line numbers first.

I was confused about the voice notification system until I traced through the hooks configuration. The confusion was between osascript (macOS built-in) and the actual notification permission system. Clarity came when we tested and found osascript runs but notifications don't appear — it's a permission issue, not a script issue.

I expected the parallel sub-agent pattern to be obvious from the start, but I kept spawning them sequentially. The user explicitly said "$200 Max plan = ชิลล์ๆ ใช้หลายตัวก็ได้" and I finally understood: spawn multiple Task calls in ONE message. This teaches me that "parallel" means literally parallel tool calls, not sequential-but-fast.

## What Went Well

- **Proactive learning capture**: Created learning 003 without being asked → User said "ฉันชอบมาก"
- **Bridge Report**: Comprehensive analysis of 7-day weyermann history → Full knowledge transfer
- **Voice hooks working**: Both start and complete notifications fire → User hears subagent activity
- **Context-finder tested**: 8 parallel queries worked → Fast information gathering

## What Could Improve

- Kept forgetting to use context-finder (needed multiple reminders)
- Read 348-line file directly when sub-agent could have done it
- Created gist externally instead of saving URL to project file first

## Blockers & Resolutions

- **Blocker**: Context-finder not registered after creating file
  **Resolution**: Needed Claude Code restart for new agents

- **Blocker**: osascript notifications not appearing
  **Resolution**: Permission issue — need to check System Settings or use terminal-notifier

## Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - min 100 words)

**What DIDN'T work**: The osascript notification system. Commands execute successfully (exit code 0) but nothing appears. This is frustrating because the voice (say command) works perfectly but visual notifications are blocked. The fallback to terminal-notifier should have been in the original scripts from weyermann.

**What was FRUSTRATING**: Having to be reminded multiple times about context-finder. I understood the concept but kept defaulting to direct file reads. The pattern wasn't internalized until I created learnings 001 and 002. Also, speech-to-text inaccuracy made some messages hard to parse — had to guess meaning.

**What DELIGHTED me**: The user's positive reaction to proactive learning capture ("ฉันชอบมากเลยรักมากขอบคุณมาก"). Also, seeing 8 parallel context-finder queries return comprehensive weyermann analysis in seconds. And the "wait + continue" pattern working smoothly — no explicit confirmation needed.

| Contribution | Human | AI | Together |

| Direction/Vision | ✓ | | |
| Options/Alternatives | | ✓ | |
| Final Decision | ✓ | | |
| Execution | | ✓ | |
| Meaning/Naming | | | ✓ |

## Resonance Moments

- "ใช้ context-finder นะ" → Created learnings 001 + 002 → Institutionalized the pattern
- "proactive learning capture" praise → Continue doing without being asked → Reduced friction
- "$200 Max plan ชิลล์ๆ" → Parallel sub-agents allowed → Faster exploration

## Intent vs Interpretation

| You Said | I Understood | Gap? | Impact |
|----------|--------------|------|--------|
| "clone weyermann" | Clone to .tmp/ for analysis | N | Correct |
| "ใช้ context-finder" | Delegate reading to sub-agent | N | Eventually correct (after reminders) |
| "เก็บเป็นกาว" | Store raw data as ground truth | N | Created raw/ folder |
| "บวก 20%" | Add tax buffer to pricing | N | Updated templates |

**ADVERSARIAL CHECK**:
1. **Unverified assumption**: I assumed "notification not working" meant the script was broken, when it was actually a macOS permission issue
2. **Near-miss**: I almost thought "สแนปช็อต" meant screenshot when user meant the /snapshot command
3. **Over-confidence**: I was too sure that osascript would work because it ran without errors

## Communication Dynamics (REQUIRED)

### Clarity
| Direction | Clear? | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| You → Me (instructions) | Mostly | Speech-to-text caused some unclear messages |
| Me → You (explanations) | Yes | Tables, summaries, commit messages |

### Feedback Loop
- **Speed**: Instant — user corrects immediately when wrong
- **Recovery**: Smooth — created learnings to prevent recurrence
- **Pattern**: "Use context-finder" needed multiple reminders → now documented

### Trust & Initiative
- **Trust level**: Right — user let me execute without micromanaging
- **Proactivity**: Balanced — proactive learning capture was praised
- **Assumptions**: Should ask when speech-to-text is unclear

### What Would Make Next Session Better?
- **You could**: Use "ผิด" or "ไม่ใช่" clearly when I misunderstand speech-to-text
- **I could**: Confirm unclear messages before acting, use context-finder by default
- **We could**: Install terminal-notifier for reliable notifications

## Seeds Planted

- **Incremental**: Add CLAUDE.md hub file → **Trigger**: Next session start
- **Incremental**: Weekly learning summaries → **Trigger**: End of week
- **Transformative**: claude-voice-notify as separate repo → **Trigger**: When used in 3+ projects
- **Moonshot**: Full Oracle system with cross-repo monitoring → **Trigger**: When gh + MCP integrated

## Teaching Moments

- **You → Me**: "Context-finder first, always" — discovered when reminded 3+ times — matters because saves main context and enables parallel exploration
- **Me → You**: Parallel sub-agents in single message — discovered when demonstrating 8 queries — matters because 10x faster than sequential
- **Us → Future**: learnings/001-003.md — created because patterns kept being forgotten — use when starting new session or onboarding new context

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: Proactive learning capture (don't wait to be asked) - Reduces user friction
- **Pattern**: Context-finder before Read - Saves tokens, enables parallel queries
- **Discovery**: osascript notifications need System Settings permission - Use terminal-notifier as fallback
- **Discovery**: Speech-to-text errors → confirm when uncertain - Prevents wasted work

## Next Steps

- [ ] Fix notification display (terminal-notifier or System Settings)
- [ ] Create CLAUDE.md hub file
- [ ] Respond to Luc*** with budget acceptance
- [ ] Send workshop outlines to pending requests
