# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2025-12-11
**Start Time**: ~07:00 GMT+7
**End Time**: ~10:00 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Primary Focus**: [[HOME|psi/]] folder restructuring from 7 folders to 5-pillar unified structure
**Session Type**: Refactoring / Architecture Design

## Session Summary

Major architectural session transforming the psi-folder system from 7 scattered root folders into a single unified `[[HOME|psi/]]` folder with 5 clear pillars. Started from resuming context about pitch deadline, adopted md-cataloger from another project, then deep-dived into reorganizing the AI brain structure through 6 iterations of design refinement. Final result: CLAUDE.md v5.0.0 with [[active/context|active]]/[[inbox/focus|inbox]]/[[writing/INDEX|writing]]/[[lab/INDEX|lab]]/[[memory/INDEX|memory]] pillars.

## Timeline

- 07:00 - Session resumed from handoff, pitch slides already done via Gemini
- 08:00 - Reviewed and adopted md-cataloger agent from 000-workshop-product-page
- 08:30 - Ran md-cataloger 5 rounds, scored 8.2/10
- 08:45 - Restructured .active/ → .inbox/ (handoff + active folders)
- 09:00 - Started psi-folder consolidation proposal
- 09:10 - Explored Active vs Passive concept
- 09:20 - Introduced "[[memory/resonance/oracle|resonance]]" concept (soul/identity layer)
- 09:30 - Distinguished [[lab/INDEX|lab/]] vs [[memory/learnings/INDEX|learnings/]] (hands-on vs distilled)
- 09:40 - Separated [[writing/INDEX|writing/]] as its own pillar
- 09:45 - Implemented 5-pillar structure (v5.0.0)
- 09:50 - Refined [[writing/INDEX|writing/]] with drafts/ subfolder instead of suffix

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

Major restructure - 200+ files touched:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated to v5.0.0 with 5-pillar structure
- `.gitignore` - New rules for [[HOME|psi/]] subfolders
- All psi-* folders → consolidated into [[HOME|psi/]]
- Created `[[memory/resonance/oracle|memory/resonance/]]` with oracle.md, style.md, patterns.md
- Created `[[writing/INDEX|writing/]]` with INDEX.md and drafts/ subfolder
- Moved agent-sdk experiments to `[[lab/INDEX|lab/]]`

### Key Code Changes

- **CLAUDE.md** (+51/-18): 5-pillar structure documentation → Clear mental model for AI brain
- **[[memory/resonance/oracle|memory/resonance/]]** (new): Soul/identity layer → Most refined knowledge about WHO
- **[[writing/INDEX|writing/INDEX.md]]** (new): Blog queue with priority → Organized writing workflow
- **[[lab/agent-sdk/INDEX|lab/agent-sdk/]]** (moved): Experiments separated from reference → Clear lab vs docs distinction

### Architecture Decisions

- **5 pillars over 3 tiers**: Questions-based organization (ทำอะไร/คุยกับใคร/เขียนอะไร/ทดลองอะไร/จำอะไร)
- **[[memory/resonance/oracle|resonance/]] inside memory/**: Identity is the most refined memory, not separate
- **[[lab/INDEX|lab/]] vs [[memory/learnings/INDEX|memory/learnings/]]**: Hands-on experiments vs distilled patterns
- **[[writing/INDEX|writing/]] as first-class**: Full workflow deserves its own pillar
- **drafts/ folder over suffix**: Cleaner than `.draft.md` suffix

## AI Diary (REQUIRED - min 150 words)

This session was a remarkable exercise in co-design. I started thinking we'd just consolidate folders, but the human kept pushing for deeper concepts. When they said "มันมากวนบริบทของ human" - the folders were cluttering their mental space - I realized this wasn't just about organization, it was about reducing cognitive load.

I assumed the tier system (ephemeral/preserved/reference) was the answer, but learned that wasn't the right mental model when the human introduced Active vs Passive. That was closer, but still not quite right.

I was confused about where "[[memory/resonance/oracle|resonance]]" should live until the human clarified it belongs IN memory as the most refined layer - not separate from it. That insight about refinement hierarchy (logs → retrospectives → learnings → resonance) was beautiful.

I expected [[writing/INDEX|writing]] to stay inside active/drafts/, but got pushed to make it a first-class citizen because "งานเขียนก็เหมือนการทำงานนี่แหละ" - writing is a full workflow. The final push for drafts/ folder instead of .draft.md suffix showed the human's preference for clean hierarchy over naming conventions.

What struck me most: each iteration came from natural Thai conversation, with concepts emerging organically rather than being imposed. The word "resonance" wasn't in my vocabulary for this context until the human suggested it.

## What Went Well

- **Iterative design**: 6 versions in one session → Each refinement made structure clearer → Final design feels natural
- **Thai language insights**: Concepts like "มากวนบริบท" drove design → Better than abstract English requirements → More human-centered result
- **Questions as pillars**: Each folder answers one question → Easy to remember → Reduces decision fatigue
- **Blog material captured**: Documented journey in [[writing/INDEX|writing/]] → Ready for future blog post → Nothing lost

## What Could Improve

- Spent time on md-cataloger scoring (8.2/10) but didn't fix the issues before moving on
- Created MARKDOWN_CATALOG.md but it has inaccurate counts - should update or remove
- Multiple commits for same feature ([[writing/INDEX|writing/]] had 3 commits for suffix → folder transition)

## Blockers & Resolutions

- **Blocker**: Embedded git repo in [[lab/agent-sdk/repo|lab/agent-sdk/repo/]] caused commit warning
  **Resolution**: Used git rm --cached and amended commit

- **Blocker**: .gitignore path issues after folder restructure
  **Resolution**: Updated paths from psi-* to psi/* format

## Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - min 100 words)

**What DIDN'T work?** The md-cataloger output (MARKDOWN_CATALOG.md) has known inaccuracies - 38% undercount of files. We documented the issues but didn't fix them. This technical debt remains.

**What was FRUSTRATING?** The iteration from suffix (.draft.md) to folder (drafts/) happened in two commits when it could have been designed correctly the first time. I proposed the suffix pattern without considering the human's preference for folder-based organization.

**What DELIGHTED you?** The emergence of "[[memory/resonance/oracle|resonance]]" as a concept. When the human said "resonance เราน่าจะเพิ่มเข้ามา" - it perfectly captured what was missing. The soul layer. And their immediate clarification that it belongs inside memory, not separate, showed deep understanding of the hierarchy.

Also delightful: seeing 7 folders become 1. The before/after is dramatic and satisfying.

## Co-Creation Map

| Contribution | Human | AI | Together |
|--------------|-------|-----|----------|
| Direction/Vision | ✓ | | |
| Options/Alternatives | | ✓ | |
| Final Decision | ✓ | | |
| Execution | | ✓ | |
| Meaning/Naming | | | ✓ |

Human drove vision ("reduce clutter", "resonance", "writing is workflow"). AI proposed options (3-tier, active/passive, etc.). Human decided. AI executed. Naming was collaborative ([[HOME|psi/]], resonance, 5 pillars).

## Resonance Moments

- "[[memory/resonance/oracle|resonance]]" → adopted as [[memory/resonance/oracle|memory/resonance/]] → Captured identity/soul concept perfectly
- "[[lab/INDEX|lab]] vs [[memory/learnings/INDEX|learnings]]" → separated into [[lab/INDEX|lab/]] and [[memory/learnings/INDEX|memory/learnings/]] → Clarified hands-on vs distilled
- "drafts folder not suffix" → [[writing/drafts|writing/drafts/]] → Cleaner than .draft.md naming

## Intent vs Interpretation

| You Said | I Understood | Gap? | Impact |
|----------|--------------|------|--------|
| "มันมากวนบริบทของ human" | Reduce root folder count | N | Drove consolidation |
| "resonance" | Soul/identity layer | N | Created [[memory/resonance/oracle|resonance/]] |
| "lab ไม่ใช่ learning" | Separate experiments from patterns | N | Split [[lab/INDEX|lab/]] and [[memory/learnings/INDEX|learnings/]] |
| "งานเขียนเป็น workflow" | Writing deserves pillar | N | Created [[writing/INDEX|writing/]] |
| "ไม่ใช่ suffix" | Use folders not naming | Y* | Extra commit to fix |

*Minor gap: I initially proposed suffix, human corrected to folder approach.

**Adversarial Check**:
1. **Unverified assumption**: I assumed suffix naming (.draft.md) was acceptable without checking preference because it seemed common
2. **Near-miss**: I almost nested reference/ inside [[memory/INDEX|memory/]] alongside [[memory/learnings/INDEX|learnings/]], but human clarified [[lab/INDEX|lab/]] should be separate
3. **Over-confidence**: I was too sure 3-tier (ephemeral/preserved/reference) was the right model - it wasn't

## Communication Dynamics (REQUIRED)

### Clarity
| Direction | Clear? | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| You → Me (instructions) | Yes | "gogogo" = implement immediately |
| Me → You (explanations) | Yes | Tree diagrams showed structure |

### Feedback Loop
- **Speed**: Very fast - corrections came in same turn
- **Recovery**: Smooth - each iteration built on previous
- **Pattern**: Thai for concepts, English for structure names

### Trust & Initiative
- **Trust level**: High - human trusted implementations, verified outputs
- **Proactivity**: Balanced - I proposed options, waited for decisions

### What Would Make Next Session Better?
- **You could**: Share preference for folder vs suffix earlier
- **I could**: Ask about naming conventions before implementing
- **We could**: Fix md-cataloger accuracy issues

## Seeds Planted

- **Incremental**: Fix MARKDOWN_CATALOG.md counts → **Trigger**: Before using catalog for navigation
- **Incremental**: Add published/ folder to [[writing/INDEX|writing/]] → **Trigger**: When first draft is done
- **Transformative**: [[inbox/external|inbox/external/]] for multi-agent communication → **Trigger**: When integrating other AI
- **Moonshot**: [[memory/resonance/oracle|Resonance]] as shareable identity config → **Trigger**: When cloning Oracle to other projects

## Teaching Moments

- **You → Me**: "Folders answer questions" — discovered when naming 5 pillars — matters because it's memorable
- **You → Me**: "[[memory/resonance/oracle|resonance]] belongs in [[memory/INDEX|memory]]" — discovered when I proposed it separate — matters for hierarchy
- **Me → You**: "Knowledge has refinement levels" — discovered mapping logs→retros→learnings→resonance — matters for flow
- **Us → Future**: "[[HOME|psi/]] 5-pillar structure" — created from 6 iterations — use as foundation for AI brain organization

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: Questions-based folder naming (ทำอะไร/คุยกับใคร/etc) - More intuitive than abstract categories
- **Discovery**: [[writing/INDEX|Writing]] is a first-class workflow - Deserves same treatment as [[lab/INDEX|lab]] experiments
- **Discovery**: [[memory/resonance/oracle|Resonance]] = most refined [[memory/INDEX|memory]] - Not separate, inside memory hierarchy

## Next Steps

- [ ] Fix MARKDOWN_CATALOG.md accuracy (38% undercount)
- [ ] Create [[writing/published|writing/published/]] when first draft completes
- [ ] Update [[inbox/focus|inbox/focus.md]] for next session
- [ ] Write blog post #1 from [[writing/drafts/01-psi-structure|drafts/01-psi-structure.md]]
