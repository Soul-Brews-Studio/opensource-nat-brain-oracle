.claude/agents/oracle-keeper.md (90/10 fix)
.claude/commands/oracle.md (90/10 fix)
```

### Key Code Changes

- **Skills system**: Created 4 SKILL.md files with proper frontmatter → Enables auto-invoked knowledge injection
- **/standup command**: Dispatches to context-finder for daily standup → Saves tokens using Haiku
- **90/10 fix**: Changed "90% code, 10% beer" → "Energy allocation strategy, NOT laziness" → Corrects fundamental misunderstanding

### Architecture Decisions

- **Skills vs Subagents**: Skills = reusable knowledge (model-invoked), Subagents = isolated workers (explicitly spawned)
- **Resume Agent**: Can continue agent sessions with `resume: "agentId"` → Powerful for multi-step research
- **GitHub analysis location**: [[lab/INDEX|Lab]] for experiment, [[memory/resonance/oracle|resonance]] for distilled essence

## AI Diary (REQUIRED - min 150 words)

This session was a learning journey about Claude Code's newer features. I assumed Skills would be similar to subagents - just another way to spawn workers - but learned they're fundamentally different when I read the docs. Skills are model-invoked knowledge that Claude automatically loads based on context, while subagents are explicitly spawned isolated workers. This changes how we should design the system.

I was confused about the Resume Agent feature until I actually tested it. I expected it might just pass some context forward, but was surprised that the resumed agent genuinely remembered the entire previous conversation - it knew we found 36 retrospective files and could immediately tell me the most recent one. This is powerful for multi-step research tasks where context would otherwise be lost.

I expected the 90/10 correction to be simple - just change a few words - but discovered it was scattered across 5+ files in different formats. The source of truth wasn't clear, and different files had evolved independently with slightly different phrasings. This taught me that philosophy/principles need a single canonical source.

## What Went Well

- **Skills implementation**: All 4 skills loaded correctly on first try → Claude recognized them immediately → Enables reusable knowledge patterns
- **Experiment methodology**: Designed measurable tests before implementing → All 4 tests passed → Clear documentation of what works
- **Subagent delegation**: Used context-finder for heavy lifting → Saved tokens and got comprehensive GitHub scan
- **90/10 correction**: Found and fixed all 5 files systematically → Consistent philosophy across codebase

## What Could Improve

- **Initial confusion**: Took a while to understand Skills vs Subagents distinction
- **File scattering**: 90/10 was defined in too many places with slight variations
- **Interruption handling**: Session context got a bit fragmented when restarting to test skills

## Blockers & Resolutions

- **Blocker**: Skills needed session restart to load
  **Resolution**: Restarted session, all skills loaded correctly

- **Blocker**: 90/10 meaning scattered across files
  **Resolution**: Used context-finder to find all occurrences, fixed systematically

## Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - min 100 words)

**What DIDN'T work**: The initial attempt to understand 90/10's true meaning required multiple searches. The information was fragmented across retrospectives, lessons, and philosophy files without a clear canonical source. I had to piece together the correct interpretation from multiple hints.

**What was FRUSTRATING**: Having to restart the session to test Skills. I wish there was a way to reload skills without losing conversation context. Also, the Resume Agent test required multiple tool calls to verify it worked.

**What DELIGHTED me**: The Resume Agent feature exceeded expectations! The agent genuinely remembered previous context - not just a summary, but actual working memory. Also, seeing all 4 skills load and work on first try was satisfying. The GitHub scan revealing 500+ repos and 30 organizations gave me a much richer understanding of Nat's background as a polymath developer.

## Co-Creation Map

| Contribution | Human | AI | Together |
|--------------|-------|-----|----------|
| Direction/Vision | ✓ | | |
| Options/Alternatives | | ✓ | |
| Final Decision | ✓ | | |
| Execution | | ✓ | |
| Meaning/Naming | | | ✓ |

## Resonance Moments

- **Skills naming**: AI suggested 4 skills based on existing patterns → Human approved → Names reflect actual workflow
- **90/10 correction**: Human flagged the issue → AI found all occurrences → Together refined the correct wording
- **GitHub analysis**: Human requested to understand them better → AI proposed [[lab/INDEX|lab]]/[[memory/resonance/oracle|resonance]] structure → Human approved

## Intent vs Interpretation

| You Said | I Understood | Gap? | Impact |
|----------|--------------|------|--------|
| "gogogo" | Proceed with implementation | N | Smooth execution |
| "จัดมาให้หมดเลย" | Run all tests systematically | N | Complete experiment |
| "แก้ไข 90/10 ทั้งหมด" | Find and fix all occurrences | N | Comprehensive fix |
| "โคลนเก็บ GitHub" | Clone repos for analysis | Y | I started scanning first, not cloning |

**Adversarial Check**:
1. **Unverified assumption**: I assumed Skills would load immediately without restart because the docs didn't explicitly say restart was needed
2. **Near-miss**: I almost thought "90/10" was just about work-life balance when the user said it's not laziness - had to dig deeper
3. **Over-confidence**: I was too sure the GitHub scan would be quick, but 500+ repos required significant processing

## Communication Dynamics (REQUIRED)

### Clarity

| Direction | Clear? | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| You → Me (instructions) | ✓ | "gogogo" was clear after context |
| Me → You (explanations) | ✓ | Test results shown in tables |

### Feedback Loop

- **Speed**: Misalignments caught within 1-2 exchanges (90/10 correction)
- **Recovery**: Smooth - you flagged issue, I fixed systematically
- **Pattern**: Voice input sometimes unclear but meaning derivable from context

### Trust & Initiative

- **Trust level**: Appropriate - you let me execute but verified results
- **Proactivity**: Balanced - I proposed options, you decided

### What Would Make Next Session Better?

- **You could**: Let me know canonical source for philosophy (which file is source of truth)
- **I could**: Check for duplicate definitions proactively before they diverge
- **We could**: Create a "single source of truth" pattern for important concepts

## Seeds Planted

- **Incremental**: Add more skills as patterns emerge → **Trigger**: When a pattern is used 3+ times
- **Transformative**: GitHub profile → personality model → **Trigger**: After deep repo analysis
- **Moonshot**: AI that truly knows Nat's full coding history → **Trigger**: When all repos analyzed

## Teaching Moments

- **You → Me**: "90/10 is energy allocation, not laziness" — discovered when you corrected my misunderstanding — matters because it's a core philosophy that affects all guidance
- **Me → You**: "Resume Agent preserves full context" — discovered when testing the feature — matters because it enables multi-step research without context loss
- **Us → Future**: "Skills system implemented" — created because reusable knowledge patterns needed — use when adding new knowledge domains

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: Skills = model-invoked knowledge, Subagents = explicitly spawned workers - different use cases
- **Discovery**: Resume Agent genuinely preserves context - game changer for research
- **Pattern**: Philosophy concepts need single source of truth to prevent drift

## Next Steps

- [ ] Deep dive into key GitHub repos
- [ ] Create timeline.md with life phases
- [ ] Distill to [[memory/resonance/github-personality|resonance/github-personality.md]]
- [ ] Write blog post about Claude Code features (draft exists)
