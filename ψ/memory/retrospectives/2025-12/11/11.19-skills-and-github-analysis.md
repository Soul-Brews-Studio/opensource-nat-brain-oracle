# Session Retrospective: Skills System + GitHub Analysis

**Date**: 2025-12-11
**Time**: 09:47 - 11:19 GMT+7 (~1.5 hours)
**Focus**: Claude Code features experiment + GitHub profile analysis

---

## What We Did

### 1. Claude Code Features Experiment
- Tested 4 new features: Skills, /standup, Explore agent, Resume Agent
- All tests passed
- Created experiment docs in `ψ/lab/claude-code-features/`

### 2. Skills System Created
| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| oracle-philosophy | Knowledge management principles |
| five-pillar-structure | ψ/ folder navigation |
| security-first | Git safety rules |
| subagent-dispatch | When to use subagents |

### 3. 90/10 Correction
- Fixed misconception: NOT "don't work hard"
- Correct: Energy allocation strategy
- 90% AI engagement, 10% renewal

### 4. GitHub Profile Analysis
- Scanned nazt profile: 500+ repos, 30 orgs
- Life phases identified: Maker → Blockchain → Brewing → AI/Oracle
- Created `ψ/lab/github-profile-analysis/INDEX.md`

## Key Learnings

1. **Skills ≠ Subagents**
   - Skills = reusable knowledge (model-invoked)
   - Subagents = isolated workers (explicitly spawned)

2. **Resume Agent works**
   - Agent remembers context from previous step
   - Powerful for multi-step research

3. **90/10 is energy allocation**
   - Not laziness, not work-life balance
   - Full capacity mode with intentional rest

4. **GitHub reveals personality**
   - Polymath: Hardware + Blockchain + AI
   - Life phases clearly visible in repos

---

## Files Created

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.claude/skills/` (4 files) | Skills system |
| `.claude/commands/standup.md` | Daily standup |
| `ψ/inbox/schedule.md` | Appointments |
| `ψ/lab/claude-code-features/` | Experiment |
| `ψ/lab/github-profile-analysis/` | Profile analysis |
| `ψ/writing/drafts/05-*.md` | Blog draft |

## Human State

- Started session tired (post-brewing cleanup)
- Energy increased through productive work
- Interested in self-discovery via GitHub

---

## Next Actions

- [ ] Deep dive GitHub repos
- [ ] Write blog post on Claude Code features
- [ ] Prepare oracle-starter-kit for Dec 18

---

## AI Observations

Session demonstrated good pattern: Main agent supervises, Haiku subagents do heavy lifting. Skills system enables knowledge reuse across sessions. Resume Agent enables multi-step research without context loss.
