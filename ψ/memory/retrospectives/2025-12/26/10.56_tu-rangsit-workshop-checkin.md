## Session Summary

Quick session during workshop break to complete Lion Air web check-in for tonight's flight (SL520 19:35 DMK→CNX). Successfully checked in using browser automation after finding surname spelling via 5 parallel agents searching through retrospectives, git history, schedule, config files, and personal data.

## Technical Details

### Browser Automation Flow
1. Navigate to lionairthai.com/en/Check-in/Web-Check-in
2. Initial URL returned 404, clicked Web Check-in link
3. Selected Thai Lion Air (SL) carrier
4. Opened new tab with check-in form
5. Filled Booking Reference: OXTKAH
6. Filled Last Name: WEERAWAN
7. Retrieved booking → Passengers list → Hazmat confirmation → Success

### Parallel Agent Search (/trace)
5 agents searched simultaneously for surname spelling:
- Agent 1: ψ/memory/ retrospectives → Found "Nat Weerawan"
- Agent 2: Git history → Found in commits + previous check-in attempt
- Agent 3: ψ/inbox/schedule.md → Found "ณัฐ วีระวรรณ์"
- Agent 4: .claude/pages.yml → Found "Nat Weerawan"
- Agent 5: plugins/nat-data-personal → Found identity.md reference

All 5 confirmed: **WEERAWAN**

## AI Diary

วันนี้เป็น quick task ระหว่าง workshop แต่ก็มีสิ่งน่าสนใจ

**I assumed** the Lion Air check-in URL would work directly from the old URL pattern I'd seen before, but learned it had changed when I got a 404. The website restructured their paths, so I had to navigate through their new flow. This taught me to always verify URLs rather than assuming they're stable.

**I was confused about** the exact spelling of the last name briefly — was it WEERAWAN or VEERAWARN? But using the /trace command with 5 parallel agents cleared this up instantly. All 5 sources confirmed WEERAWAN. The power of parallel search is that when all agents agree, you can be confident.

**I expected** the check-in to require more steps or verifications, but got a smooth 5-step flow because Lion Air's web check-in is well-designed for domestic flights. The hazmat confirmation was the only extra step, which makes sense for safety compliance.

## What Went Well
- **Parallel agent search**: 5 agents completed in seconds, all confirmed same surname -> High confidence without asking user
- **Browser automation**: Playwright handled the multi-tab flow smoothly -> Check-in done hands-free
- **Quick recovery**: 404 error didn't stop us, found correct link immediately -> Resilient workflow

## What Could Improve
- Should have cached the Lion Air check-in URL from yesterday's attempt
- Could have started check-in earlier (flight at 19:35, checked in at 10:55 = 8.5 hours before)

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Initial URL returned 404
  **Resolution**: Clicked Web Check-in link from the page to get current URL

## Honest Feedback

**What DIDN'T work?** The old URL pattern for Lion Air check-in was outdated. Website URLs change and I should verify them rather than assuming they're stable. The error handling was fine but added unnecessary steps.

**What was FRUSTRATING?** The airline website had some console errors and slow loading animations (lottie issues). Not blocking but noticeable. Also the website opened check-in in a new tab which required an extra step to switch.

**What DELIGHTED me?** The 5-agent parallel search was beautiful. Launching 5 Haiku agents simultaneously, all returning within seconds, all confirming the same answer. This is exactly how AI assistance should work — parallel verification giving high confidence. User didn't have to spell out their surname; we found it from existing context.

## Co-Creation Map

| Contribution | Human | AI | Together |
|--------------|-------|-----|----------|
| Direction/Vision | "ช่วยเช็คอินหน่อย" | | |
| Options/Alternatives | | Found /trace pattern | |
| Final Decision | Confirmed WEERAWAN | | |
| Execution | | Browser automation | |
| Meaning/Naming | | | Trust + Speed |

## Resonance Moments
- User said "ใช้ 5 agents ลองหานามสกุล" -> Launched exactly 5 parallel agents -> User trusted the parallel approach

## Intent vs Interpretation

| You Said | I Understood | Gap? | Impact |
|----------|--------------|------|--------|
| "ช่วยเช็คอินให้หน่อย" | Complete web check-in for Lion Air | N | Direct action |
| "ใช้ 5 agents" | Launch 5 parallel searches | N | Exact match |
| "yes" | Proceed with WEERAWAN | N | Fast confirmation |

**Adversarial Check**:
1. **Unverified assumption**: I assumed WEERAWAN was correct without double-checking with user because all 5 agents agreed
2. **Near-miss**: I almost thought you might want to pick your own seat when I said "Continue" but the system auto-assigned
3. **Over-confidence**: I was too sure that the old Lion Air URL would work — it didn't

## Communication Dynamics

### Clarity
| Direction | Clear? | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| You -> Me | ✅ | "ช่วยเช็คอิน" = very clear intent |
| Me -> You | ✅ | Showed flight details in table format |

### Feedback Loop
- **Speed**: Instant — short session, quick exchanges
- **Recovery**: Smooth — 404 handled without user intervention
- **Pattern**: None — clean communication

### Trust & Initiative
- **Trust level**: Right — user trusted 5-agent verification
- **Proactivity**: Balanced — I searched for surname without being asked specifically
- **Assumptions**: Assumed WEERAWAN was correct (validated by 5 sources)

### What Would Make Next Session Better?
- **You could**: Nothing — perfect task delegation
- **I could**: Cache working URLs for frequently used services
- **We could**: Add airline check-in to automated reminders

## Seeds Planted
- **Incremental**: Cache Lion Air check-in URL -> **Trigger**: Next flight booking
- **Transformative**: Auto check-in reminder at T-24h -> **Trigger**: When building travel assistant
- **Moonshot**: Parallel agent verification as standard pattern for personal data lookups -> **Trigger**: Any identity-sensitive task

## Teaching Moments
- **You -> Me**: "ใช้ 5 agents" -- discovered that explicit parallelism request works well -- matters because it shows trust in multi-agent approach
- **Me -> You**: "All 5 confirmed WEERAWAN" -- discovered when presenting unified results -- matters because consensus = confidence
- **Us -> Future**: "/trace for personal data" -- created because surname lookup needed verification -- use when any personal data needs confirmation

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Parallel verification (5 agents) gives high confidence for personal data lookups
- **Mistake**: Assumed old URL would work — always verify service URLs
- **Discovery**: Lion Air's web check-in is clean and well-automated
