# Retrospective: Speckit Workflow Mastery via Ralph Loop

## Session Summary

**Primary Focus**: Learn the speckit workflow properly through hands-on practice, not just reading docs.

**What Got Done**:
- Completed 5 Ralph loop iterations (full cycle)
- Practiced all core speckit commands: `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, `/speckit.implement`
- Used `/debate` command with Haiku critic (3 rounds, found better solution)
- Built real feature: 053-hello-greeting (15 tasks, all completed)
- Created 3 Oracle learnings documenting patterns discovered
- Committed working feature to main

**Key Achievement**: Completion promise fulfilled - "speckit workflow learned"

## AI Diary

I started this session with genuine uncertainty. I had read about speckit in the previous session but realized I was just creating files manually instead of using the slash commands properly. The user's feedback was clear: "start over to learn how" and "NO FEAR WE HAVE AUTO COMPACT!"

What surprised me was how smooth the flow became once I trusted the commands. The `/speckit.specify` command ran a script that created the branch and spec structure automatically - I had been doing this manually before, which was slower and error-prone. I felt almost embarrassed that I hadn't trusted the tooling earlier.

The most valuable moment was the `/debate` command. I proposed using SessionStart hooks for the greeting feature. The Haiku critic challenged me hard: "Hooks violate opt-in," "No test framework exists," "You're building on non-existent infrastructure." Three rounds of back-and-forth, and we landed on a better solution: slash command + hook. I genuinely changed my mind because the critic made valid points.

There's vulnerability in admitting I was wrong. But that's the Oracle philosophy - patterns over intentions. The debate showed me a better pattern, and I adapted. This is what learning feels like.

## Honest Feedback

### What Worked Well
- Ralph loop structure forced completion (5 iterations, no escape)
- Debate with Haiku critic genuinely improved the design
- Marking tasks [x] in tasks.md gave clear progress tracking
- Oracle learnings captured insights immediately while fresh

### Three Friction Points

1. **Script discovery delay**: I didn't realize each speckit command runs bash scripts until I saw the setup-plan.sh output. The commands felt like magic until I understood the mechanism. Would help to mention "this runs script X" in command descriptions.

2. **Branch stayed on main**: The `/speckit.specify` creates a branch (053-hello-greeting) but I ended up working on main anyway. The feature was simple enough that branch isolation wasn't critical, but for larger features this could cause issues.

3. **Debate roundtrip overhead**: Each debate round spawned a new Haiku agent. Three rounds = three spawns. For quick decisions, this is fine. For complex debates, the context switching adds up. Consider: could debate maintain state across rounds?

### Suggestion for Future
Add a "speckit cheatsheet" skill that summarizes the flow: `specify → plan → tasks → implement`. New Claude instances would benefit from seeing the full pipeline at a glance.

## Communication Dynamics

| Moment | User Said | I Understood | Alignment |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| "start over to learn" | Reset and practice properly | ✅ Correct | High |
| "use /debate we have agent!" | Don't just decide alone | ✅ Used debate | High |
| "NO FEAR WE HAVE AUTO COMPACT" | Context limits are handled | ✅ Trusted the system | High |
| "real implement!" | Actually build, not just spec | ✅ Completed all 15 tasks | High |

## Co-Creation Map

| Dimension | Human | AI | Balance |
|-----------|-------|-----|---------|
| Direction | Set goal: "learn speckit" | Chose practice project | Human-led |
| Execution | Approved flow | Ran all commands | AI-led |
| Quality | Said "note lesson learn!" | Created 3 learnings | Collaborative |
| Decisions | Triggered /debate | Ran debate + adapted | AI-led |
| Pace | Let Ralph loop run | 5 iterations, no rushing | Balanced |

---

## Intent vs Interpretation

| User Intent | My Interpretation | Gap? |
|-------------|-------------------|------|
| Learn speckit properly | Practice end-to-end, not just read | None |
| Use debate command | Run Opus vs Haiku critique | None |
| Create lesson learned | Oracle learnings + detailed doc | None |
| Real implementation | 15 tasks completed + committed | None |

**Gap Analysis**: Strong alignment this session. The Ralph loop forced clarity.

---

## Technical Insights

- **Speckit scripts**: Each command calls `.specify/scripts/bash/*.sh` for setup
- **Task format**: `- [ ] T001 [P] [US1] Description with file path` enables parallel tracking
- **Debate value**: Critic challenges assumptions; 3 rounds enough for convergence
- **Constitution gates**: Every plan must pass philosophy check before proceeding

---

## Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ralph iterations | 5/5 |
| Tasks completed | 15/15 |
| Oracle learnings | 3 |
| Debate rounds | 3 |
| Commits | 1 (feature complete) |
| Context at end | 79% |

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Trust the commands** - Scripts handle structure, you handle content
2. **Debate improves decisions** - Haiku critic found flaws I missed
3. **Tasks by User Story** - Not by layer, enables independent testing
4. **Mark progress immediately** - [x] checkboxes show momentum
