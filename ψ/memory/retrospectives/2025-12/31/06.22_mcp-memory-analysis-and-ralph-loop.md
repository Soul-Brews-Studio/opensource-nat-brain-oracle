# Session Retrospective: MCP Memory Analysis & Ralph Loop

## Session Summary

Analyzed and documented two complementary MCP memory systems (claude-mem vs Oracle), ran a 5-iteration Ralph loop to test the loop mechanism, and created comprehensive documentation.

## What Got Done

### Merged to Main
- `dfeadd8` - Playwright tests + speckit tasks complete
- `7cc12dc` - claude-mem vs Oracle comparison report
- `56d0cdc` - claude-mem tool usage guide
- `af53dfa` - Integration ideas document
- `96ba41f` - Final summary

### Documents Created
1. **Comparison Report** - Side-by-side feature analysis
2. **Usage Guide** - Practical examples for all 6 claude-mem tools
3. **Integration Ideas** - 5 ways to bridge both systems
4. **Summary** - Key statistics and recommendations

### Ralph Loop Testing
- Successfully ran 5 iterations with `max_iterations: 5`
- Hook properly incremented iteration counter
- Loop terminated correctly at iteration 5
- Fixed earlier bug where `active: false` wasn't being checked

## Technical Insights

### claude-mem vs Oracle

| Aspect | claude-mem | Oracle |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Purpose | Session memory | Knowledge wisdom |
| Tools | 6 | 5 |
| Records | ~140 obs | 1810+ learnings |
| Search | Keyword | Hybrid (FTS5+Vector) |
| Write | Auto (hooks) | Manual |

**Key insight**: They're complementary:
- claude-mem = "What happened?"
- Oracle = "What should I do?"

### Ralph Loop Behavior
- State file at `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md`
- Hook reads frontmatter, increments iteration
- `max_iterations: 5` worked correctly
- Must delete state file to fully stop stale hooks

## AI Diary

Starting New Year's Eve with documentation work. The Ralph loop ran smoothly this time - fixing the `active: false` bug earlier helped. The 5-iteration requirement forced me to create progressively more detailed documents, which was actually productive.

Interesting observation: claude-mem has better temporal context tools (timeline), while Oracle has better semantic search (vectors). The integration ideas document captures how they could work together - auto-promoting learnings from session observations to Oracle's knowledge base.

Context at 88% - wrapping up cleanly.

## Honest Feedback

**Session effectiveness**: 8/10
- Good: Created 4 useful documents, all pushed to main
- Good: Ralph loop worked as expected
- Minor: Could have explored more edge cases

**Documentation quality**: 7/10
- Comparison is comprehensive
- Usage guide has practical examples
- Integration ideas are speculative but valuable

**What worked well**:
- Using ralph-loop to force multiple iterations
- Parallel tool calls for exploration
- Committing after each major document

**What could improve**:
- Earlier planning of all 5 iterations
- More real-world usage testing

## For Next Session

1. Test integration ideas (auto-promote learnings)
2. Close issue #77 (ralph-local plugin done)
3. Consider adding timeline tools to Oracle MCP
