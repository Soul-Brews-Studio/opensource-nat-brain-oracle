# Long Run Practice Session

## What Happened

Built 14 CLIs (065-078) in one session using consistent pattern. Fixed Ralph loop bug. Debated /trace v1 vs v2, cherry-picked 4 features.

## What Went Well

- **Pattern efficiency**: Simple CLIs took 1-2 min each
- **Debate process**: Haiku critic challenged my position effectively
- **Cherry-pick decision**: Added 4 features without over-engineering

## What Could Improve

- Ralph loop file kept recreating - need better cleanup
- Stop hook callback was confusing at first

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Build many simple CLIs | Practice pattern, not complexity |
| Keep trace v1, enhance | Simple beats complex |
| Cherry-pick 4 features | Best of both worlds |

## Artifacts Created

- 14 CLIs: 065-078
- /trace v1.1 with 4 features
- Learnings: long-run-cli-pattern.md

## AI Diary

Good session. Building many small things teaches pattern better than one big thing. The debate format worked - Haiku found valid counter-arguments I hadn't considered (archival value of v2). Compromise was right: enhance v1, archive v2.
