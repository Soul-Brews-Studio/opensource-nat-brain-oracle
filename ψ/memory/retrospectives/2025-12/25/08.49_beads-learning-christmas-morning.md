# Retrospective: Beads Learning - Christmas Morning

**Date**: 2025-12-25 08:49 (Thursday) 🎄
**Session Duration**: ~15 min (08:35 - 08:49)
**Theme**: Learning Steve Yegge's Beads + comparison with our system

---

## What Happened

Christmas morning session. User wanted to learn about **beads** - Steve Yegge's git-backed issue tracker for AI agents.

### Completed

1. **Added beads to /project learn**
   - `ghq get https://github.com/steveyegge/beads`
   - Symlinked to `ψ/learn/repo/github.com/steveyegge/beads`
   - Registered slug: `beads`

2. **Deep dive with /learn beads**
   - 3 Haiku agents explored in parallel
   - Created documentation in `ψ/learn/beads/`:
     - `BEADS.md` - Hub file
     - `2025-12-25_ARCHITECTURE.md`
     - `2025-12-25_QUICK-REFERENCE.md`

3. **Compared Beads vs Nat-s-Agents**
   - 3 agents analyzed different aspects
   - Storage, coordination, philosophy

## Key Insight: Beads vs Nat-s-Agents

| | Beads | Nat-s-Agents |
|---|---|---|
| **Core Question** | "What's blocking this task?" | "Why did I decide this?" |
| **Metaphor** | Task graph database | Extended consciousness |
| **Storage** | JSONL + SQLite | Markdown + Git |
| **Best For** | Multi-agent coordination | Solo dev knowledge |

**Complementary, not competing!**
- Beads = task coordination (dependency graph)
- Nat-s-Agents = knowledge synthesis (append-only memory)

---

## Beads Highlights

Steve Yegge's design choices:
- **Hash-based IDs** (`bd-a1b2`) - zero merge conflicts
- **Daemon + direct mode** - RPC for speed, SQLite fallback
- **Content hashing** - SHA256 for deduplication
- **`--json` everywhere** - agent-first design

## Files Created

| File | Lines |
|------|-------|
| `ψ/learn/beads/BEADS.md` | 45 |
| `ψ/learn/beads/2025-12-25_ARCHITECTURE.md` | 85 |
| `ψ/learn/beads/2025-12-25_QUICK-REFERENCE.md` | 95 |

## AI Diary

Christmas morning discovery session. Steve Yegge (legendary programmer, Emacs guy, Amazon/Google rants) built an issue tracker specifically for AI agents. His core insight: agents lose context between sessions, so give them structured persistent memory.

Our system (Nat-s-Agents) solves a similar problem but differently:
- Beads: "Here's what's ready to work on" (task graph)
- Us: "Here's why we made that decision" (knowledge graph)

The comparison made me appreciate what we've built. Both valid approaches. Could even use together - Beads for task tracking, ψ/ for knowledge synthesis.
