# 🕐 07:45 - 100 Image Prompts Generation Session

## Session Summary
Generated 100 new Antigravity image prompts (301-400) using hybrid approach: Main agent (Opus) gathered deep context, created 10 category briefs, then launched 10 parallel Haiku agents to generate prompts.

## What Happened

### Phase 1: Context Gathering
- Retrieved existing prompt history (204 prompts Dec 11, 6 parallel agents)
- Found visual style system (monochrome + cyan + gold)
- Identified gaps: Oracle philosophy, MAW patterns, ψ/ pillars not yet visualized

### Phase 2: Category Design (Main Agent)
Created 10 category briefs with deep Oracle context:
1. **301-310**: Oracle Philosophy (Nothing is Deleted, Patterns Over Intentions, etc.)
2. **311-320**: ψ/ Knowledge Pillars (active, inbox, writing, lab, memory)
3. **321-330**: MAW Multi-Agent (5 agents, worktree, sync, orchestrator)
4. **331-340**: Subagent Personas (context-finder, coder, marie-kondo, etc.)
5. **341-350**: Command Workflows (/trace, /snapshot, /distill, /jump)
6. **351-360**: Learning Patterns (distillation loop, delegation, consensus)
7. **361-370**: Energy & Rhythm (sprint-recovery, 90/10, DustBoy day)
8. **371-380**: Anti-Patterns (force push danger, zombie agents, rate limits)
9. **381-390**: Graduated Projects (FloodBoy, Headline, Arthur, Antigravity)
10. **391-400**: Teaching & Workshop (metaphor > technical, live demo)

### Phase 3: Parallel Generation
- Launched 10 Haiku agents simultaneously
- Each agent received category brief + style guide + 10 prompt assignments
- All completed in ~3 minutes parallel

### Phase 4: Organization
- Moved prompts from `ψ/writing/slides/` to `scripts/prompts/`
- Named as `antigravity-[NNN]-[slug].md`
- Created `MASTER-AUTO-301-400.md` for long-runner automation

## Artifacts Created

| Type | Count | Location |
|------|-------|----------|
| Image prompts | 100 | `scripts/prompts/antigravity-301-*.md` to `antigravity-400-*.md` |
| Master doc | 1 | `scripts/prompts/MASTER-AUTO-301-400.md` |
| Results dir | 1 | `scripts/prompts/results/` |

**Total prompts now**: 130 (30 existing + 100 new)

## Key Decisions

1. **Hybrid approach chosen**: Main agent context + parallel Haiku generation
   - Why: Haiku agents can't access full Oracle memory
   - Solution: Main agent creates rich category briefs, Haiku executes

2. **Moved to scripts/prompts/**: User caught that slides/ was wrong location
   - Prompts belong with automation scripts, not slides

3. **MASTER-AUTO format**: Reused proven pattern from Dec 11 batch
   - Progress tracker, prompt tables, automation commands

## Patterns Observed

### What Worked
- **10 parallel agents = ~3 min for 100 prompts** (vs 40+ min sequential)
- **Category-first design**: Each agent focused on one domain
- **Rich context briefs**: Enabled Haiku to produce quality despite limited memory

### What Could Improve
- Some agents saved to different directories (inconsistent)
- Need consolidation script for scattered outputs

## AI Diary

วันนี้เป็นวันคริสต์มาสอีฟ แต่ยังทำงานอยู่ 😄

The 100-prompt generation felt like a good synthesis of everything learned:
- Parallel agent pattern from MAW
- Context-finder first pattern (gather before generate)
- Category-first design from original 204 prompts
- Oracle philosophy actually became visual prompts (meta!)

สิ่งที่น่าสนใจคือ prompts 301-310 เป็น Oracle Philosophy เอง — visualizing the very concepts that guide how I work. "Nothing is Deleted" as geological strata, "Patterns Over Intentions" as heatmap. The system documenting itself.

## Session Stats
- **Duration**: ~25 minutes (23:41 - 07:45, overnight context)
- **Prompts generated**: 100
- **Parallel agents**: 10
- **Categories**: 10
- **Files created**: 101 (100 prompts + 1 master doc)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Run `./agents/1/scripts/antigravity-auto.sh 301 90`
- [ ] Commit prompts to repo
- [ ] Generate 100 images (~2.5 hours)
