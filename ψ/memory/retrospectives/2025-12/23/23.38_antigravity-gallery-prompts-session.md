# Retrospective: Antigravity Gallery + Prompt Display

**Date**: 2025-12-23 23:38
**Duration**: ~20 minutes (continued from summarized session)
**Type**: Feature completion + trace

---

## What Happened

### 1. Completed Gallery Prompt Display Feature

Continued from previous session where gallery was deployed but prompts weren't showing alongside images.

**Changes made to `public/index.html`**:
- Added side-by-side layout (image left, prompt right)
- Created `loadPrompt()` function to fetch markdown files
- `extractPrompt()` parses `## Prompt` section from markdown
- Updated `navigate()` to load prompts when using arrow keys
- Responsive design (stacks on mobile <1000px)

**Commit**: `2862dde feat: show prompts alongside images in lightbox`
- 212 files changed (211 prompt files + index.html)
- Pushed to GitHub

### 2. Traced Antigravity Prompt Generation History

User asked about how prompts were generated. Found:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Dec 11 | 204 prompts created using 6 parallel Haiku agents |
| Dec 13 | Automation scripts created (`antigravity-auto.sh`) |
| Dec 15 | Spinoff to own repo |
| Dec 23 | Gallery deployed + prompts feature |

**Key insight**: Parallel generation with 6 Haiku agents = ~1.5 hours for 204 prompts (vs 40+ min sequential)

### 3. Started New Prompt Generation (Interrupted)

User requested 100 new prompts. Started analysis with 3 parallel agents to:
1. Analyze existing categories/gaps
2. Find new concepts from learnings
3. Check CLAUDE.md for concepts

**Interrupted** before agents completed — user wanted `rrr` instead.

## What Changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Gallery shows images only | Gallery shows image + prompt side-by-side |
| Prompts in separate files | Prompts fetched dynamically in lightbox |
| No trace of generation history | Documented Dec 11 parallel generation process |

## AI Diary

This session was a continuation — the gallery was already built, I just needed to add the prompt display. The technical work was straightforward: fetch markdown, parse the `## Prompt` section, display in a panel.

The `/trace` command worked well for understanding the antigravity history. The pattern of 6 parallel Haiku agents generating 204 prompts is elegant — category-first design ensures visual coherence.

When user asked for 100 new prompts, I started properly (analyze existing → find gaps → generate). But interrupted before any output. That's fine — the analysis structure was correct.

## Honest Feedback

**Good**:
- Gallery feature complete and pushed
- Trace gave clear history of prompt generation
- Started new prompt generation with proper analysis phase

**Could improve**:
- The 100 new prompt task wasn't completed — only started
- Could have asked upfront what themes user wanted vs. doing full analysis first

## Lessons Learned

1. **Prompt extraction regex**: `## Prompt\s*\n```[\s\S]*?\n([\s\S]*?)```/` works for markdown code blocks
2. **6 parallel Haiku agents** = optimal for bulk prompt generation (from Dec 11 session)
3. **Category-first design** ensures visual language coherence

## Session Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Files modified | 1 (index.html) |
| Files added | 211 (prompts to public/) |
| Commits | 1 |
| Traces run | 2 |
| New prompts generated | 0 (interrupted) |

---

**Next**: If user wants to continue, run the 3 analysis agents and then generate 100 new prompts in batches using parallel Haiku agents.
