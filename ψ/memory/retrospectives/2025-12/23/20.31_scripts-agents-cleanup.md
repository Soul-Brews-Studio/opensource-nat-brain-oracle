## What Happened

Traced `scripts/` and `.claude/agents/` to identify stale/unused items.

### Archived to `.archive/2025-12-23/`

**Agents** (4):
- `tong-finder.md` - Demo agent for Tong training, complete
- `wip-keeper.md` - Not seen in active use
- `api-scanner.md` - U-LIB specialized, rarely used
- `archiver.md` - Planned but unused

**Scripts** (1):
- `security-check.sh` - Replaced by security-scanner subagent

### Remaining Active Agents (13)

Core workflow agents kept:
- context-finder, coder, executor
- marie-kondo, repo-auditor, security-scanner
- new-feature, note-taker, oracle-keeper
- project-keeper, project-organizer
- md-cataloger, guest-logger

## Key Insight

**Subagent replaced script**: `security-check.sh` (Dec 9) was superseded by `security-scanner` subagent. The subagent pattern is more maintainable than standalone scripts.
