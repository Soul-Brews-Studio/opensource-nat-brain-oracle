## Technical Details

### Files Created
- `.claude/commands/random.md` — log notes with AI interpretation
- `ψ/memory/resonance/advisor-seth.md` — PhD advisor context
- `reunion/INDEX.md` — folder overview
- `reunion/the-headline.md` — AI news platform
- `reunion/weyermann.md` — MAW prototype
- `reunion/maw.md` — Multi-Agent Workflow Kit

### Architecture Decisions
- **reunion/ at root level** — ข้างๆ projects/, ไม่ใช่ใน ψ/
- **resonance/ for people** — advisor-seth.md อยู่ใน ψ/memory/resonance/
- **/random logs gitignored** — local only, ไม่ commit

## AI Diary

Session ยาวและหลากหลาย — เริ่มจาก WIP cleanup แต่กลายเป็น deep dive หลายเรื่อง

**I assumed** the phrase "อ.เส" was the correct nickname but user corrected to "อ.เศรษฐ์" — learned that consistency matters even in nicknames.

**I was confused about** the relationship between weyermann and MAW at first. I thought MAW was defined IN weyermann, but actually weyermann is the PROTOTYPE that led to MAW toolkit being extracted. User clarified: "weyermann คือต้นแบบ... ตอน FloodBoy workshop ทำเป็น demo แต่สุดท้ายกลายเป็น MAW ที่ดีที่สุด"

**I expected** reunion/ to be a simple folder with a few entries, but it became a rich documentation of project relationships — the-headline (AI news), weyermann (MAW origin), maw (toolkit). Each one has its own story.

**What delighted me**: Seeing the FloodBoy workshop content added to maw.md. It has the origin story, YouTube links, short codes (CCC, NNN, RRR), and the philosophy "Don't Think. Feel it." This is living documentation.

**What was hard**: Keeping track of all the moving pieces — user sent multiple chat logs (Minniez, อ.เศรษฐ์), asked for interpretations, corrections, and new features. Had to context-switch often.

## What Went Well

- **reunion/ folder complete** — 4 projects tracked with proper context
- **advisor-seth.md** — important relationship documented with upcoming deadlines
- **/random command** — quick capture for random notes
- **User corrections accepted** — "อ.เส" → "อ.เศรษฐ์", interpretation fixes

## What Could Improve

- **Ask about nicknames first** — should have asked "อ.เส หรือ อ.เศรษฐ์?"
- **Demo deadline tracking** — 16 ธ.ค. is 3 days away, should have flagged urgency earlier

## Honest Feedback

**What DIDN'T work?** The Minniez chat interpretation was wrong (ชิน not Claude). Fixed but shows AI fills gaps with assumptions.

**What was FRUSTRATING?** Context switching between tasks — WIP cleanup → /random → advisor → reunion. Each was valuable but jumping around loses momentum.

**What DELIGHTED me?**
- The reunion/ concept is elegant — graduated projects come back for context
- FloodBoy workshop content is rich — "Don't Think. Feel it."
- Seeing weyermann → MAW relationship clarified

## Key Learnings

### 1. Reunion Pattern
```
🌱 Seed → 🌕 Grow → 🎓 Grad → 🤝 Reunion
```
Projects graduate but Oracle keeps context.

### 2. MAW Origin
weyermann = prototype → FloodBoy workshop demo → extracted as MAW toolkit

### 3. Resonance for People
Important relationships go to ψ/memory/resonance/ — not random notes, not projects, but WHO matters.

## Next Steps

- [ ] ส่งคลิปตัวอย่าง ARTHUR → อ.เศรษฐ์ (ASAP!)
- [ ] Demo 16 ธ.ค. (คุณวิชัย) — 3 days!
- [ ] voice-notify reunion entry
