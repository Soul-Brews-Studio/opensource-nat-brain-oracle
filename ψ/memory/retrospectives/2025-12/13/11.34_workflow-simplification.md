# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2025-12-13
**Start Time**: ~10:54 GMT+7 (continuation)
**End Time**: 11:34 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~40 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Workflow Simplification
**Session Type**: Refactoring

## Session Summary

Short continuation session focused on simplifying commands and clarifying flows. Changed rrr→snapshot flow, simplified /snapshot (128→55 lines), and clarified /forward is for fresh start (not compact).

## Timeline

- 10:54 - Session resume
- 10:55 - /snapshot without title → AI derives
- 11:00 - Simplified /snapshot command
- 11:06 - rrr flush mode
- 11:14 - /snapshot to extract lessons
- 11:25 - /forward for fresh start
- 11:34 - Final rrr

## Key Changes

| Change | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Flow | snapshot→rrr | rrr→snapshot |
| /snapshot | 128 lines | 55 lines |
| /forward | before compact | before /clear |

## AI Diary

This short session was about removing friction. The user kept pointing out complexity I'd introduced. "มันยากจังอ่ะ มันก็ควรจะง่ายง่ายป่ะ" — this became the theme.

I assumed more documentation meant better guidance. Wrong. The user showed me: if AI can figure it out, don't ask. If the flow is confusing, simplify it. If the command is long, cut it.

The rrr→snapshot flow change surprised me. I'd been thinking "capture learning before you forget" but the user's logic was cleaner: rrr creates data, snapshot extracts patterns. You can't extract from nothing.

Flush mode is elegant. When context is low, don't waste it on subagents. Just write what you know. Like Unix sync before shutdown.

## What Went Well

- Quick iterations on feedback
- Simplifications landed immediately
- Flow clarification resolved confusion

## Honest Feedback

**What DIDN'T work**: I still defaulted to complexity. Had to be corrected multiple times.

**What was FRUSTRATING**: The repeated simplification cycles. Should have started simple.

**What DELIGHTED**: User's clear mental models (rrr=flush, forward=fresh start).

## Co-Creation Map

| Contribution | Human | AI | Together |
|--------------|-------|-----|----------|
| Direction/Vision | ✓ | | |
| Options/Alternatives | | ✓ | |
| Final Decision | ✓ | | |
| Execution | | ✓ | |
| Meaning/Naming | ✓ | | |

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- **Discovery**: rrr first creates data for snapshot to extract
- **Rule**: /forward = fresh start, not compact

## Next Steps
