# Retrospective: Full Session - MAW + Antigravity Automation

> **Session**: 23:04 - 23:42 (38 minutes)
> **Date**: Saturday 13 December 2025
> **Focus**: MAW Profile14 setup + Antigravity image generation automation

---

## Executive Summary

This session accomplished two major goals:
1. **MAW Profile14** - Complete multi-agent setup with 5 agents, 2 windows × 3 panes
2. **Antigravity Automation** - Auto-reminder script to generate 126 remaining images

Both systems are now running autonomously.

## Timeline (Detailed)

### Phase 1: Context Recovery (23:04-23:06)

| Time | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 23:04 | `/recap` | Fresh context loaded |
| 23:05 | `/trace maw` | 5 parallel subagents traced all MAW files |
| 23:06 | Analysis complete | Found 000-workshop has more complete setup |

**Key Discovery**: `000-workshop-product-page` has Profile14 (2 windows × 3 panes) that we needed.

### Phase 2: MAW Setup (23:08-23:22)

| Time | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 23:08 | Test `maw hey all` | Working! Basic session running |
| 23:10 | Copy profiles 10-14 | Added to `.agents/profiles/` |
| 23:11 | Subagent diff analysis | Found critical gaps (scripts, config) |
| 23:14 | Copy critical scripts | maw-wrapper, wait-agents-fast, etc. |
| 23:16 | `maw kill` attempt | **HUNG** - discovered y/N prompt issue |
| 23:17 | User: "never kill" | Tried to work with existing session |
| 23:18 | User: "kill please" | Tried `maw kill` again - hung again |
| 23:19 | Subagent debug | Used `tmux kill-session` directly - **SUCCESS** |
| 23:20 | Start profile14 | Only 1 window (wrong layout!) |
| 23:21 | Copy start-agents.sh | Profile14 layout support added |
| 23:22 | Restart profile14 | **SUCCESS** - 2 windows × 3 panes |

**Mistakes Made & Fixed**:
1. Copied profiles without script → Layout code missing
2. Used `maw kill` → Has interactive prompt
3. Didn't check agents.yaml → Only 3 agents defined
4. Multiple retries without debugging → Wasted time

**Pattern Learned**: `Config → Setup → Script → Start`

### Phase 3: Documentation (23:22-23:31)

| Time | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 23:22 | Document mistakes | `maw-setup-mistakes.md` created |
| 23:23 | Update WIP | Full MAW status documented |
| 23:24 | rrr retrospective | Journey documented |
| 23:26 | /snapshot | Pattern extracted |
| 23:27 | Create journey index | Full timeline mapped |
| 23:31 | Commit | `6dc2a3b` - 1639 lines added |
| 23:32 | /forward | WIP updated for next session |

### Phase 4: Antigravity Automation (23:32-23:42)

| Time | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 23:32 | `/trace antigravity` | Found osascript automation |
| 23:33 | Check progress | 84/210 images done |
| 23:34 | Create `antigravity-auto.sh` | Infinite generator script |
| 23:35 | Create `antigravity-tmux.sh` | tmux wrapper |
| 23:35 | Start generator | Rate limit hit (reset 00:11) |
| 23:38 | Test osascript | Wrong target (HOME.md not sidebar) |
| 23:39 | Fix with cliclick | Installed + mouse click on sidebar |
| 23:40 | Test again | **SUCCESS** - clicks sidebar input |
| 23:41 | Create `antigravity-remind.sh` | Sends MASTER-AUTO.md reminder |
| 23:42 | Start in tmux | Running every 5 minutes |

**osascript Fix**:
- Problem: Cmd+L toggles sidebar, Tab goes to wrong field
- Solution: Use `cliclick` for precise mouse click on sidebar input
- Result: Script now clicks correct input area

## Systems Now Running

### 1. MAW Multi-Agent System
```

Profile: profile14
Layout: 2 windows × 3 horizontal panes

WINDOW 1: Agents 1-3
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Agent 1     │ Agent 2     │ Agent 3     │
│ Shadow      │ Executor    │ Executor    │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘

## Key Learnings

### 1. MAW Copy Order Pattern
```
Config → Setup → Script → Start
```
NOT: Start → Debug → Realize missing

### 2. Interactive Scripts Don't Work from Automation
- `maw kill` has `read -p` (y/N prompt)
- Use `tmux kill-session -t <name>` instead

### 3. osascript Click Precision
- Keyboard shortcuts can toggle wrong things
- Use `cliclick` for precise mouse positioning
- Calculate position from window bounds

### 4. Subagent Delegation Saves Time
- 5 parallel traces completed in seconds
- Debug subagent found root cause faster
- Main agent orchestrates, subagents investigate

---

## Mistakes & Recovery

| Mistake | Time Lost | Recovery |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Profiles without script | ~5 min | Copy start-agents.sh |
| maw kill hangs | ~3 min | Use direct tmux command |
| Wrong click target | ~2 min | Install cliclick, calculate position |
| Multiple retries | ~2 min | Delegate to subagent for debug |

**Total Time Lost**: ~12 minutes
**Recovery Method**: Subagent investigation + precise fixes

## AI Diary

This session was intense - 38 minutes covering two completely different systems (MAW multi-agent and Antigravity image generation). The key insight was recognizing when to stop retrying and start investigating.

The MAW setup taught me about the relationship between config files and implementation scripts. Just copying profiles doesn't work if the start script doesn't know how to interpret them. This is a general pattern: configuration declares intent, code implements it.

The Antigravity fix was satisfying - moving from keyboard shortcuts (unreliable) to mouse clicks (precise). Sometimes the "hacky" solution (calculating pixel positions) is more robust than the "clean" one (keyboard navigation).

I'm proud of the documentation output - 6 MAW learning files, 2 retrospectives, and a journey index. This knowledge will make future MAW setups trivial.

The antigravity-remind script is now running autonomously. By morning, many more images should be generated. The system works without human intervention.

## Honest Feedback

### What Went Well
- Subagent delegation was excellent
- Quick pivots when things didn't work
- Comprehensive documentation
- Two working systems by end of session

### What Could Improve
- Should have done full diff FIRST before copying
- Should have checked script contents before running
- Could have parallel'd more operations
- osascript testing could have been faster

### For Next Time
- Always: `diff -r source/ target/` before copying
- Always: Check for `read`, `select` in scripts
- Always: Test automation with simple message first
- Consider: cliclick for any GUI automation
