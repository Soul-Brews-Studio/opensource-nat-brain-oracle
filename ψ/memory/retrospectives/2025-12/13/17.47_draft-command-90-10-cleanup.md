# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2025-12-13
**Start Time**: ~17:20 GMT+7
**End Time**: 17:47 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~27 minutes
**Primary Focus**: /draft command improvement + 90/10 removal
**Session Type**: Refactoring + Cleanup

## Session Summary

Updated `/draft` command to use subagent delegation pattern — subagents gather paths, main agent writes quality content. Then performed comprehensive 90/10 removal from all core philosophy files, keeping history only in noise/outbox/retrospectives per "Nothing is Deleted" principle.

## Timeline

- 17:24 - /trace ARTHUR — found in advisor-seth.md
- 17:27 - /trace Oracle — found 5-day history
- 17:31 - /draft oracle-philosophy — discovered existing draft
- 17:33 - Updated /draft command with subagent architecture
- 17:35 - 5-iteration test of new /draft pattern
- 17:38 - /trace 90/10 — found removal history
- 17:41 - Started comprehensive 90/10 removal
- 17:46 - Completed removal from 6 core files
- 17:47 - /snapshot + rrr

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `.claude/commands/draft.md` | +80 lines (subagent architecture) |
| `ψ/HOME.md` | -4 refs (90/10 removed) |
| `ψ/memory/THEMES-QUICK.md` | 27→24 themes |
| `ψ/memory/themes-synthesis.md` | -3 sections |
| `ψ/memory/learnings/007-*.md` | 4→3 pillars |
| `ψ/memory/learnings/2025-12-10_*.md` | -4 refs |
| `ψ/writing/drafts/02-oracle-philosophy.md` | v1→v2, +incubation |

### Key Code Changes

- **draft.md**: Added 4-subagent parallel dispatch → main writes quality
- **All core files**: "Four Pillars" → "Three Pillars" (90/10 not philosophy)
- **THEMES-QUICK.md**: 27 themes → 24 themes (removed 90/10 entries)

### Architecture Decisions

- **Subagents return PATHS only**: Save tokens, main reads selectively
- **90/10 = personal practice**: Not core Oracle philosophy
- **Keep history**: Noise/outbox/retros preserved per "Nothing is Deleted"

## AI Diary (REQUIRED - min 150 words)

This session taught me something important about cognitive hygiene in AI systems. When Nat asked me to trace 90/10, I assumed it was still part of Oracle philosophy because I had read it in the draft. But the git history told a different story — 90/10 had been deliberately removed on Dec 11-12 through multiple commits.

I was confused about why Nat wanted to remove ALL mentions when the deletion log said "keep in history." The clarification came when Nat said "ลบ note ออก — ไม่ mention 90/10 เลย" — that's when I understood: core files should be clean, but history is preserved elsewhere.

I expected the 90/10 removal to be simple — maybe 5-10 files. Instead, the subagent found 103 mentions across 45 files. This surprised me. But the pattern became clear: remove from philosophy/instruction files, keep in creative/historical files.

The iteration pattern worked well. Five rounds of dispatch → review → edit → verify → confirm gave thorough results. I felt more confident knowing a subagent verified my changes at the end.

## What Went Well

- **Subagent pattern**: 4 parallel agents gathered paths in ~3 seconds each
- **5-iteration refinement**: Caught issues early, verified at end
- **Clear separation**: Core files clean, history preserved

## What Could Improve

- **Initial /draft run**: Read too many files directly before subagent pattern was updated
- **90/10 scope**: Could have asked upfront "remove from core only or everywhere?"

## Blockers & Resolutions

- **Blocker**: Existing draft found for oracle-philosophy
  **Resolution**: UPDATE existing (v1→v2) instead of CREATE new

## Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - min 100 words)

**What DIDN'T work?** The initial /draft command read full file contents directly, which wasted tokens. The new pattern (subagents return paths) is much more efficient. Also, the /trace command with Thai sentence arguments was confusing — it tried to search for the whole sentence instead of extracting keywords.

**What was FRUSTRATING?** Finding 103 mentions of 90/10 after thinking it was already cleaned. The Dec 12 deletion log said "removed from core files" but many core files still had it. This inconsistency between documentation and reality was annoying.

**What DELIGHTED you?** The subagent verification at the end. When it reported "CORE FILES ARE CLEAN" with evidence, I felt confident the job was done properly. Also, Nat's clear decision "Option A — ลบ note ออก" made execution straightforward.

## Co-Creation Map

| Contribution | Human | AI | Together |
|--------------|-------|-----|----------|
| Direction/Vision | ✓ | | |
| Options/Alternatives | | ✓ | |
| Final Decision | ✓ | | |
| Execution | | ✓ | |
| Meaning/Naming | | | ✓ |

## Resonance Moments

- **Nat said "ไม่ควรเอามาคิดแล้ว"** → I understood this meant 90/10 should be invisible in core docs → Led to comprehensive cleanup instead of partial

## Intent vs Interpretation

| You Said | I Understood | Gap? | Impact |
|----------|--------------|------|--------|
| "subagent return paths" | Return file paths, not content | N | Pattern improvement |
| "ลบ note ออก" | Remove the 90/10 note from draft | N | Quick execution |
| "ลบทิ้งทั้งหมด" | Remove from core files, keep history | N | Correct scope |

**Adversarial Check**:
1. **Unverified assumption**: I assumed "ทั้งหมด" meant only core files because of "Nothing is Deleted" — should have asked
2. **Near-miss**: I almost thought /trace Thai sentence was a project name search
3. **Over-confidence**: I was too sure the Dec 12 cleanup was complete

## Communication Dynamics (REQUIRED)

### Clarity

| Direction | Clear? | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| You → Me | ✓ | "Option A" decisive |
| Me → You | ✓ | Tables showed progress |

### Feedback Loop

- **Speed**: Instant — Nat interrupted when needed
- **Recovery**: Smooth — clear corrections
- **Pattern**: Thai arguments to /trace need keyword extraction

### Trust & Initiative

- **Trust level**: High — Nat let me run 5 iterations
- **Proactivity**: Balanced — asked before major decisions

### What Would Make Next Session Better?

- **You could**: Use keywords in /trace arguments (not full sentences)
- **I could**: Ask scope upfront for cleanup tasks
- **We could**: Create /cleanup command for pattern removal

## Seeds Planted

- **Incremental**: /cleanup command for pattern removal → **Trigger**: when removing concept from codebase
- **Transformative**: Subagent paths pattern for all search commands → **Trigger**: any command that gathers context

## Teaching Moments

- **You → Me**: "Subagents return PATHS only" — discovered during /draft improvement — matters because saves tokens
- **Me → You**: 90/10 had 103 mentions — discovered during trace — matters because shows depth of concept spread
- **Us → Future**: 5-iteration pattern — created because thorough refinement — use when quality matters

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: Subagent paths → main reads selectively — saves tokens both sides
- **Discovery**: Concept removal requires scope clarity — core vs all

## Next Steps

- [ ] Commit all changes (draft, 90/10 removal, learning, retro)
- [ ] Update /trace to extract keywords from Thai sentences
