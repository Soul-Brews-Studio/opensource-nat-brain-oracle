## Session Outcomes

### Major Accomplishments
1. **Oracle Philosophy Released**
   - Public github.com/Soul-Brews-Studio/oracle-starter-kit
   - 6 production files (not simplified)
   - 4 Pillars explained to live audience

2. **AI Diary Investigation Complete**
   - Root cause identified: PreToolUse hook duplication
   - 5 investigation files documenting findings
   - Pattern analysis: hook conflicts cause diary silence

3. **PreToolUse Hook Bug Fixed**
   - Duplicate hook entries removed
   - Hook discovery system corrected
   - Plugin system now stable

4. **Nat's Priorities Documented**
   - Frequency analysis of 73 context files
   - Key principle: "สิ่งที่พูดซ้ำบ่อย = สิ่งที่สำคัญ"
   - 90/10 balance understood as energy allocation (2025+ full capacity)

5. **Project Organization**
   - ψ prefix adopted across all consciousness-tier folders
   - Context folder convention: seq_project/name.md
   - 73 context files → consolidated for clarity

### Technical Discoveries
- AppleScript terminal integration works bidirectionally
- Plugin hook auto-discovery requires correct structure
- Session lifecycle tied to plugin hook initialization

## Key Learnings

### Rules Discovered
1. **Permission Before Action** - Always ask user before file operations
2. **Copy Real Files** - Use production files, not simplified versions
3. **Rules = Starting Points** - Understanding > blind compliance
4. **Pattern Over Intention** - Frequency reveals importance ("สิ่งที่พูดซ้ำบ่อย")

### System Understanding
- **context-finder** = the key to everything (as stated by Nat)
- Framework stays same regardless of which AI
- Human-AI workflow: feed context → AI distills → CLAUDE.md

### Energy Model (90/10)
- NOT "be lazy" but energy allocation strategy
- 2025+ = full capacity mode: 90% AI capability, 10% personal (beer/rest)
- Balance = sustainable high-performance
