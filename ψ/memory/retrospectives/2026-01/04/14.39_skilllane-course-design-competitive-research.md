# Session Retrospective: SkillLane Course Design + Competitive Research

**Date**: 2026-01-04 (Sunday)
**Time**: 13:58 - 14:39
**Duration**: ~41 minutes
**Model**: Claude Opus 4.5

---

## Session Summary

Designed 3 SkillLane-format courses based on existing course content, conducted competitive research on Toh Framework (Wasin Treesinthuros), and traced previous discussions about social media strategy (buildwithai.org domain).

---

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Toh Framework Research (via MCP Chrome)

| Finding | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Product** | Free OSS SaaS Builder AI Agent Framework |
| **Creator** | Wasin Treesinthuros (ดร.โต) - Innovation Vantage |
| **Website** | tohframework.dev |
| **Position** | Tool (not course) - complementary to us |
| **Key insight** | "We teach skills, they give tools" |

**Corrected earlier error**: Toh Framework is NOT Tommy Labs Studio (Sadhu). They are separate competitors.

### 2. SkillLane Course Design (3 versions)

| # | Course | Price | Duration |
|---|--------|-------|----------|
| 01 | AI Builder with Claude Code (No-Code) | ฿1,590 | 8h 45m |
| 02 | Claude Code Master Class for Business | ฿2,490 | 7h 20m |
| 03 | AI Automation Workflow | ฿1,990 | 6h 30m |

**Format follows**: CodingThailand (โค้ชเอก) SkillLane style with our philosophy:
- "สอนตกปลา ไม่ใช่ให้ปลา"
- No-code focus (vs coding tutorials)
- Business owners target (vs developers)

### 3. Oracle Learnings Saved

| Learning | Concepts |
|----------|----------|
| SkillLane Course Format Pattern | course-design, skilllane, thai-market |
| Thai AI Education Market Competitors | sadhu, toh, codingthailand, pricing |
| Advanced Claude Code Setup (from Thai community) | hooks, subagents, ralph-wiggum |
| Nat-s-Agents vs Community Comparison | setup-comparison, best-practices |

### 4. Social Media Strategy Traced

Found previous decisions from Dec 2025:
- **Domain**: `buildwithai.org`
- **Two FB pages**: @buildwithai (human) + @oracle.md (AI)
- **Philosophy**: "Multiple physicals, one soul"
- **Blog plan**: Astro + Cloudflare Pages (started planning)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 3 course tiers | Cover beginner → advanced path |
| SkillLane format | Match Thai market expectations |
| Price ฿1,590-2,490 | Competitive with โค้ชเอก |
| buildwithai.org for blog | Use existing domain decision |

## AI Diary

**Honest reflection**: This was a productive session with good flow. The user has clear vision for course design and competitive positioning.

**Interesting moment**: I incorrectly assumed Toh Framework = Tommy Labs Studio (Sadhu) based on both being in Thai AI education space. User correctly called this out - good reminder to verify facts, not assume connections.

**What went well**:
- MCP Chrome browsing worked smoothly
- SkillLane format matched user expectations
- /trace found previous social media discussions quickly

**What could improve**:
- Should have traced buildwithai.org decision earlier before asking domain questions
- Blog planning started but interrupted - may need follow-up session
