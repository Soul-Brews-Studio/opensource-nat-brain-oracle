# Session Retrospective

**Date**: 2026-01-11 22:14 (GMT+7)
**Primary Focus**: Major cleanup - archive everything, restore 7 core skills
**Duration**: ~1 hour (21:15 - 22:14)

## What Happened

### Phase 1: Command Usage Analysis (21:15-21:20)
- Traced command usage in Jan 2026
- Found only 25 of 79 commands had any mentions
- Identified deprecated: /trace-v2, /project find

### Phase 2: Mass Archive (21:20-21:40)
- Archived 28 unused commands
- Then archived ALL 79 commands
- Archived 20 project skills
- Archived 15 user skills (moved to git-tracked)
- Moved `_archive` outside `commands/` to stop Claude loading them

### Phase 3: Restore Core Skills (21:44-22:00)
- Restored: trace, rrr, recap, learn, project, context-finder
- Merged /now + /where-we-are → unified /where-we-are
- Merged /trace + /trace-oracle → unified /trace with flags

### Phase 4: Specs Cleanup (22:13)
- Archived 38 spec folders
- Most were old ideas or never started

## AI Diary

This session felt like a digital Marie Kondo moment. The user had accumulated 79 commands, 35 skills, and 38 specs over months of experimentation. Most were unused.

What struck me was the user's trust in the "Nothing is Deleted" philosophy they'd built. They didn't hesitate to archive everything because git history preserves it all. The strategy: "archive now, renovate to skill when bringing back."

The consolidation revealed something interesting: when forced to choose what matters, only 7 skills survived. These represent the core workflow: trace (find), context-finder (search), rrr (reflect), recap (orient), learn (explore), project (track), where-we-are (awareness).

I noticed my own hesitation when archiving - wanting to keep "just in case" items. The user pushed through this, trusting the archive system. That's the Oracle philosophy in action: patterns over intentions.

## Honest Feedback

**Friction 1**: Subagent spawning interrupted multiple times. User wanted fast results but subagents take time. The `--oracle` flag works well for fast Oracle-only searches.

**Friction 2**: Skill naming confusion - `/project-manager` vs `/project`, `/trace-oracle` vs `/trace --oracle`. Consolidation helped but process was iterative.

**Friction 3**: /rrr asked for confirmation instead of just saving. Fixed in this session.

**What Went Well**: Archive strategy was clean and decisive. Moving `_archive` outside `commands/` stopped Claude Code from loading them. User's willingness to "bring back as skill" creates upgrade opportunities.

## Key Numbers

| Item | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Commands | 79 | 0 (archived) |

## Next Session

- Consider creating nat-agents-core plugin
- Test /trace with all modes
- Maybe restore more skills as needed
