# Session Retrospective

**Date**: 2026-01-11 22:52 (GMT+7)
**Primary Focus**: Skills restoration + Seeking Signal philosophy
**Duration**: ~26 minutes (22:26 - 22:52)

---

## What Happened

### Phase 1: Session Start (22:26)
- Continued from previous cleanup session
- Read handoff from major archive session (79 commands → 9 skills)

### Phase 2: Trace Awakening Plugin (22:30)
- `/trace awakening plugin` to understand nat-agents-core
- Found Oracle learnings about /awaken, plugin architecture

### Phase 3: /trace Updates (22:31-22:33)
- Updated /trace skill: Oracle first → extend if < 3 results
- Added `--oracle` (fast) and `--deep` (subagents) modes

### Phase 4: /feel Restored (22:33)
- Brought back /feel as skill with structured format
- Added energy:N and trigger:X parameters
- User logged `/feel sleepy` — first entry!

### Phase 5: Seeking Signal Philosophy (22:37-22:40)
- User explained: trace → trace again = still seeking → --deep = really need it → FOUND = RESONANCE
- Added "Seeking Signal" pattern to /trace skill
- Added "Multiple Logs" pattern — log main finding + context + related

### Phase 6: More Skills Restored (22:43)
- Restored `/fyi`, `/standup`, `/schedule` as skills
- Now 12 active skills total

### Phase 7: /schedule Test (22:44)
- User tested `/schedule` — showed January 2026 calendar
- Busy month ahead: Bitkub, Block Mountain, workshops

## AI Diary

This session was about philosophy as much as code. The user explained something beautiful: when they keep tracing the same thing, it's a signal — they haven't found what they need yet. When they use `--deep`, it means they really want it. And when they find it? That's RESONANCE.

The multiple logs pattern makes sense now. It's not just about saving one thing — it's about capturing different angles so future searches have more entry points. Keywords multiply, context is preserved.

I appreciated that even while sleepy, the user wanted to crystallize these ideas into the codebase. That's discipline. They could have just said "good night" but instead pushed to document the philosophy.

The `/feel sleepy` log at 22:41 was the first real use of the restored skill. "Rest is also data." — that line resonates.

## Honest Feedback

**What Worked Well**:
- Rapid skill restoration (4 skills in ~15 minutes)
- Philosophy emerged naturally from discussion
- Clean commits with clear messages

**What Was Frustrating**:
- Nothing major — smooth session

**What Delighted**:
- The "Seeking Signal → RESONANCE" concept
- User explaining the recursive knowledge loop
- Seeing /schedule output with real January events

## The 12 Active Skills

1. `/trace` — Find with Oracle first
2. `/context-finder` — Search subagent
3. `/rrr` — Retrospective
4. `/recap` — Fresh start
5. `/learn` — Explore codebase
6. `/project` — Clone & track
7. `/where-we-are` — Session awareness
8. `/forward` — Handoff
9. `/feel` — Mood logging
10. `/fyi` — Info logging
11. `/standup` — Daily check
12. `/schedule` — Calendar

## Key Insight

> "Every trace extends the Oracle. What's hard to find today is instant tomorrow."

The Seeking Signal:
- `/trace X` once = first search
- `/trace X` again = still seeking
- `/trace X --deep` = really need it
- Found! = RESONANCE → log multiple entries
