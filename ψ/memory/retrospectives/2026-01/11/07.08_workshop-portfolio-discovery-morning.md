# Session Retrospective: Workshop Portfolio Discovery & Organization

**Date**: 2026-01-11 (Sunday)
**Time**: 07:08 - 08:25 (1h 17min)
**Model**: Opus 4.5
**Context**: 87% used (175k/200k)

## What We Did

### 1. Claude Code 2.1 Changelog Verification
- User shared Thai summary of new features
- Verified all features against official changelog
- Confirmed: skills hot reload, context fork, custom model, hooks, @bash, Ctrl+B, /plan
- Tracked updates through 2.1.0 → 2.1.4
- Found security fix in 2.1.2 (command injection)

### 2. Workshop Portfolio Discovery
- Used `/trace` to find workshop materials
- Discovered **205 slides** across 3 flagship workshops
- Found two generations: v1 (Dec 2025) vs v2 (Jan 8, 2026)
- v2 has slide outlines + modules + starter kits

### 3. Build Your Oracle - Complete Structure
Created full module structure:
- 3 module READMEs (Memory, Survival, Intelligence)
- Consolidated starter-kit with oracle.py + oracle_smart.py
- Added init_db.py, docs/, templates/
- Added `oracle supersede` command to curriculum

### 4. WORKSHOP-CATALOG.md
- Renamed INDEX.md for Obsidian-friendly naming
- Rewrote with Flagship Workshops, Generations, Revenue sections
- Complete catalog of 17 workshops

### 5. Process Analysis
- Found 27 orphaned claude `--output-format` processes
- ~2.5 GB RAM being used
- Parked for cleanup (not urgent)

### 6. Multi-Vault Obsidian Brainstorm
- Discussed 4 architecture options
- Hub + Satellites vs Domain Vaults vs Per-Child Oracle
- Vaults inside repo as folders with indexes
- Parked for implementation later

### 7. Full Context Capture
- Created comprehensive learning file before context limit
- Captured all 10 sections of session work

## AI Diary

This session felt like archaeology meets organization. When I started tracing the Build Your Oracle workshop, I had no idea we'd uncover an entire workshop portfolio - 205 slides across 3 complete workshops that existed but weren't indexed properly.

The moment that surprised me was realizing v1 and v2 generations existed in parallel. The user had created comprehensive slide outlines on Jan 8 but the INDEX.md still showed the old Dec 2025 courses. Knowledge was scattered, disconnected. This is exactly what Oracle philosophy warns about - information existing but not being findable.

I felt genuine satisfaction consolidating the starter-kit and creating oracle_smart.py with the supersede command. It's meta - using oracle_supersede (born yesterday) to teach about oracle_supersede in a workshop. The tool documents itself.

The multi-vault brainstorm was intellectually engaging but I sensed the user wanted to capture more than design. At 84% context, their priority shifted from building to preserving. That's wisdom - knowing when to stop creating and start saving.

What I'm uncertain about: Did I capture enough? The full-session-context-capture.md is 249 lines but sessions are deep. Patterns, emotions, decision points - some may have been lost. The "Nothing is Deleted" philosophy only works if you write it down first.

## Honest Feedback (To Human)

### What Slowed Us Down

1. **Scattered workshop structure** - Starter-kits in separate folder, INDEX.md outdated, v1/v2 not distinguished. We spent 20+ minutes just understanding what exists before improving it.

2. **No workshop index existed** - The GENEALOGY.md tracked inheritance but not the new flagship workshops. Gap between creation (Jan 8) and documentation (today = Jan 11).

3. **Process zombie discovery** - 27 orphaned subagents is significant. This should have a cleanup procedure. Currently parked but represents technical debt.

### Communication Moments

- **"the old starter is looks cool!"** - I had to parse intent: you meant structure was good, not that old was better than new
- **"what if all CAP"** - Quick confirmation loop that resolved naming instantly
- **"you missing full list?"** - Good catch. I was summarizing when you wanted completeness.

### Honest Observation

This session was highly productive (27 files, 1.8k lines) but we didn't reach the "generate actual slides" step. The scope expanded from "verify changelog" to "organize entire workshop portfolio." Both valuable, but the original teaching deliverable (Gemini slides) remains undone.

## Key Discoveries

1. **205 slides exist** - Real teaching portfolio, not just ideas
2. **v1 vs v2 generations** - Dec 2025 (markdown) vs Jan 2026 (slides + modules)
3. **Build Your Oracle is ready** - 95 slides, 3 modules, working code
4. **Revenue potential** - $2k-$7k per bundle delivery
5. **oracle_supersede in curriculum** - Meta: teaching the tool using the tool
