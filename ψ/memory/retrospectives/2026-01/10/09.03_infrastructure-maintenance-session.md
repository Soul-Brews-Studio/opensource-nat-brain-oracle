## AI Diary

This was a maintenance session that emerged from investigating a bug. The user noticed "Include last summary" and "Include last message" settings weren't appearing despite being enabled. We traced through logs, found the settings existed but weren't working, and decided on a clean reinstall rather than debugging.

The pivot from debugging to reinstalling was pragmatic. Sometimes the fastest path forward is starting fresh while preserving what matters (the database). This follows "Nothing is Deleted" - we kept the data, just refreshed the tooling.

The Haiku delegation rule emerged from the user's feedback about skill loading. A simple but important observation: reading long files for summarization should be delegated to Haiku, not done by the main Opus agent. Context is precious.

I appreciated the directness of this session. Quick observations, quick decisions, minimal back-and-forth.

## Honest Feedback

**What worked:**
- Fast investigation → decision → action cycle
- Preserving database during reinstall
- User's clear feedback on delegation pattern

**Friction points:**
- Initial confusion about MCP vs HTTP worker being separate
- Skill loading still reads full file into main context

**Communication:**
- Direct and efficient
- User interrupted when I was going down wrong path (debugging vs reinstall)

## Key Learning

**Haiku Delegation Pattern:**
```
Long file reading → Haiku subagent
Session reflection → Main agent (needs context)
```

This is now documented in CLAUDE_subagents.md.
