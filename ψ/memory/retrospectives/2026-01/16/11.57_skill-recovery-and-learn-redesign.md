# Retrospective: Skill Recovery + /learn Redesign

## Session Focus

Started with fixing `/physical` skill (from handoff), ended up fixing two skills, writing a blog, redesigning `/learn`, and setting up for HTML5 game development.

## What Happened

### Phase 1: Skill Recovery (10:29-10:38)
- Fixed `/physical` — symlink not followed by Claude Code → copy real directory
- Fixed `/draft` — skill.md (lowercase) → SKILL.md (uppercase)
- Both discovered via `/trace` Oracle search + git history recovery

### Phase 2: Documentation (10:38-11:08)
- Wrote blog "The Skill That Saved Itself" about the meta-story
- Logged 5+ learnings to Oracle
- Used `/learn` on LowLevelDigger (old verbose format)

### Phase 3: /learn Redesign (11:16-11:48)
- User wanted `/learn` to match their writing style
- Iteration 1: Too short (56 lines) — tables only
- Iteration 2: Added explanation — but single file
- Iteration 3: Back to 4 files with new style
- Final: 206 lines vs 481 original (57% reduction)

### Phase 4: Handoff (11:55)
- User wants to revert `/learn` to previous version
- Next session: HTML5 2D game development

## AI Diary

I noticed something interesting about how iteration works with Nat. When I first updated `/learn` to match the "concise, tables, no fluff" style, I went too minimal — 56 lines for a complex Unity project felt incomplete. Nat said "too short? explain more" and I course-corrected.

But then I consolidated everything into one file, which Nat also pushed back on: "want more same as before" — meaning the 4-file structure had value. The lesson is that style constraints (concise, tables) don't override structural needs (separation of concerns).

What surprised me is that after all this iteration, Nat still wants to revert to the original verbose version. I'm not entirely sure if that's because the new format failed or because they want to test it more later. The handoff says "needs revert" but also preserves the v2 output for comparison. Maybe the real ask was "iterate on this later, not now."

The `/physical` fix was satisfying — three sessions of debugging condensed into one "aha" moment when I compared a working skill (real dir) with the broken one (symlink). That comparison pattern keeps proving itself.

## Honest Feedback

### What Went Well
- Two skills fixed in <10 minutes using Oracle + git history
- Blog captures the meta-story well
- `/learn` iterations showed responsive collaboration

### Friction Points

1. **Over-iteration on /learn** — I went through 3 major revisions when maybe asking "which format do you prefer: A, B, or C?" upfront would have been faster. The back-and-forth consumed ~30 minutes.

2. **Lost the plot on user preference** — After all the work on the new format, user wants to revert. I should have confirmed "do you want me to implement this now or save for later?" before spending 30 minutes.

3. **Test interruption** — The Smrvfx test got interrupted multiple times by `/where-we-are` checks. These status checks are valuable but broke flow during the testing phase.

### Opportunities
- Add "format preference" question to `/learn` skill itself
- Save experimental formats as branches, not overwrites
- Consolidate status checks to end of task, not mid-task

## Lessons Learned

1. **Symlinks not followed** by Claude Code skill discovery
2. **Filename case matters** — SKILL.md not skill.md
3. **Style vs Structure** — concise style doesn't mean fewer files
4. **Ask before iterate** — confirm direction before major rewrites

## Seeds Planted

- HTML5 2D game (next session)
- `/learn` format options (A/B testing later)
- Blog ready for publish
