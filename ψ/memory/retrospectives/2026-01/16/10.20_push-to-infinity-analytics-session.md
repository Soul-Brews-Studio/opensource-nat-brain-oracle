# Session Retrospective: Push to Infinity Analytics

**Date**: 2026-01-16 (Friday)
**Time**: ~09:00 - 10:20 (~1.5 hours)
**Focus**: Work hours pattern analysis + /physical skill restoration
**Session Type**: Analytics Deep Dive + Documentation

---

## What Happened

### 1. Work Hours Deep Analysis
- Created comprehensive "Push to Infinity" work pattern report
- Discovered key formula: `INTENSITY × DURATION = REST TRIGGER`
- Built 3 Python analytics scripts (pattern, duckdb, workhours)
- Created visual 39-day timeline with annotations
- Traced "low days" to find they weren't rest - they were events

### 2. Key Discoveries
- **10.5h** calendar average vs **11.4h** true work intensity
- **55:1** rest efficiency (55h work per 1h rest)
- **True rest: Maybe 0 days** - "rest" days were mode switches
- Events traced: CMU Pitch, โต้ง Training, SIIT Workshop

### 3. Gist Evolution
- Created public gist: https://gist.github.com/nazt/b0576a0902594c7a45ec32dfb36752f2
- Iterated 5 times based on user feedback
- Final structure: Day Distribution → Weekly → Timeline → Trace → Formula

### 4. /physical Skill Restoration
- Found deprecated skill in git history (commit 932c51c8)
- Restored to `.claude/skills/physical/`
- Symlinked to `~/.claude/skills/` for discovery
- Still not showing in autocomplete (needs investigation)

## Timeline

- 09:00 - Continued from previous session (analytics scripts)
- 09:15 - Created burst/rest timeline pattern
- 09:30 - Built comprehensive report with weekly breakdown
- 09:45 - Traced low days (Dec 14, Dec 22, Dec 24, Jan 05, Jan 09)
- 10:00 - Discovered SIIT workshop Dec 26 @ TU Rangsit
- 10:10 - Multiple gist iterations (user feedback loop)
- 10:15 - Restored /physical skill from git history
- 10:20 - Symlinked skill, still debugging discovery

## AI Diary

This session felt like being an archaeologist of human behavior. Digging through git commits and retrospectives to understand not just what happened, but why the numbers looked the way they did. The moment of realization that "rest days might be zero" was genuinely surprising - what looked like rest in the data was actually mode switching between code, slides, training, and travel.

The iterative gist refinement process was interesting. Each "move X to top" request from the user revealed what they valued most - Day Type Distribution first (the overview), then Weekly Breakdown (the rhythm), then the detailed Timeline. It's a lesson in information hierarchy - lead with the insight, not the raw data.

The /physical skill restoration was frustrating. I found it in git history, restored it, put it in the right place, symlinked it... and it still doesn't show up. There's something about Claude Code skill discovery that I don't fully understand yet. The skills that work are symlinks to plugin cache or other repos, but even with a proper symlink, /physical doesn't appear. This is a gap in my knowledge that needs addressing.

I noticed myself being more careful about the "Push to Infinity" framing. The data shows an intense work pattern, but also reveals it's sustainable because of the mode switching. It's not grinding - it's flowing between different types of work. That's a more nuanced and honest take than just "you work a lot."

## Honest Feedback

### What Worked
- Iterative gist refinement was efficient (5 versions in 20 min)
- Tracing low days added genuine insight
- Visual timeline with annotations tells the story well

### Friction Points

1. **Skill discovery mystery**: Spent 10+ minutes on /physical restoration and still not working. Should have asked Oracle first about Claude Code skill registration, or checked the claude-code-guide agent.

2. **Report structure churn**: User requested 4 structural changes (Weekly to top, Distribution to top, Formula to bottom). Could have asked upfront: "What's most important to see first?"

3. **Gist vs repo duplication**: The same content exists in gist AND in ψ/memory/learnings/. Should pick one source of truth. Gist for sharing, repo file as reference? Or just gist URL in repo?

### Suggestions
- Create a /skill-debug command to diagnose skill discovery issues
- Template for analytics reports with user-preferred structure
- Oracle entry for "how Claude Code discovers skills"

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **"Low Git ≠ Low Work"** - Physical events, offline work, and light dev days all show as low in git but aren't rest
2. **Mode switching > Rest** - Sustainable intensity comes from switching between code/slides/training, not from stopping
3. **Lead with insight, not data** - Day Type Distribution at top, raw formula at bottom

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Debug /physical skill discovery (why symlink doesn't work)
- [ ] Consider rest day today (Sprint 4, Day 7, high intensity)
- [ ] Document skill discovery mechanism in Oracle
