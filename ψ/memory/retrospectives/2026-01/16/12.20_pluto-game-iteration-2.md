## Session Summary

Upgraded Pluto from physics sandbox to actual game. Added spring scoop, items, scoring, rounds — all features from LowLevelDigger comparison.

## What We Built

| Feature | Lines | Inspired By |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Spring scoop | ~60 | ScoopController.cs |
| Item class (gem/bomb) | ~90 | ItemController + prefabs |
| Score system | ~30 | Scoreboard.cs |
| Round progression | ~40 | StageManager.cs |
| Particle pouring | ~15 | DirtManager injection |
| Tray drop zone | ~20 | TrayController.cs |

**Total**: 263 → 614 lines (+351)

## Technical Decisions

1. **Spring physics** — simple formula, no Box2D needed
2. **Arc collision** — angle-based check for scoop bowl
3. **Tray detection** — bounding box, not physics trigger
4. **Game state object** — centralized round/score tracking

## AI Diary

The comparison table worked. Showing "LowLevelDigger has X, Pluto missing X" made the gap obvious. User said "too simple?" and I could immediately list what to add.

Reading ScoopController.cs revealed the spring joint pattern. The key insight: spring physics is just `velocity += (target - position) * strength` plus damping. No magic, no Box2D required.

The scoop feels satisfying. It lags behind the mouse just enough to feel physical, but not so much to feel sluggish.

## Honest Feedback

**What went well:**
- Comparison-driven development — clear goals
- Single iteration added complete game loop
- Spring physics translated cleanly to JS

**What could improve:**
- Scoop collision with particles needs work (they fall through sometimes)
- Items are hard to scoop (they're heavy, don't interact with scoop)
- No sound — feels flat

**Rating**: 8/10 — Feature complete, needs polish

## Comparison Update

| Feature | LowLevelDigger | Pluto v2 |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Particles | 1,024 | 400 |
| Spring scoop | ✓ | ✓ |
| Items | ✓ | ✓ |
| Score/rounds | ✓ | ✓ |
| GPU rendering | ✓ | ✗ (CPU) |

## Files Changed

- `Soul-Brews-Studio/pluto/index.html` (+351 lines)
- `ψ/memory/learnings/2026-01-16_spring-physics-in-canvas-games.md` (new)

## Next Iteration Ideas

1. **Sound effects** — pour, collect, bomb
2. **Item-scoop interaction** — items should move with scoop
3. **Visual polish** — particle trails, explosions
4. **Performance** — spatial grid for O(n) collision
5. **Mobile optimization** — touch gestures
