## Session Summary

Created MVP HTML5 2D physics game "Pluto" for Soul-Brews-Studio. From concept discussion to playable prototype in one iteration.

## What We Built

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Canvas setup (600x400) | ✓ |
| 300 particles with physics | ✓ |
| Gravity + friction + bounce | ✓ |
| Particle-particle collision | ✓ |
| Mouse/touch dig interaction | ✓ |
| Earth-tone color palette | ✓ |

## Technical Decisions

1. **Single HTML file** — no build, just open in browser
2. **Pure Canvas 2D** — no framework (user request)
3. **O(n²) collision** — acceptable for 300 particles
4. **HSL colors** — easy variation with random offsets

## AI Diary

Started session thinking "this could be complex" — physics engines, Box2D, etc. But user kept pushing simpler: no external repos to learn from, just build.

The MVP took maybe 5 minutes to write. 263 lines. Works immediately.

Lesson: Don't overthink game dev. Start with the simplest possible thing that moves on screen. Iterate from there.

The LowLevelDigger research was valuable for understanding patterns, but the actual implementation didn't need Unity-level complexity. Canvas 2D is powerful enough.

## Honest Feedback

**What went well:**
- Fast pivot from "learn existing repo" to "just build it"
- Single file approach = instant feedback
- Physics feels satisfying immediately

**What could improve:**
- Should have asked "simple or complex?" earlier
- Spent time searching for repos when user wanted to create new

**Rating**: 8/10 — Good velocity, could've been faster with better questions

| "create in soulbrews" | Used Oracle, found org |
| "ralph-loop go" | Built MVP |

## Files Changed

- `Soul-Brews-Studio/pluto/index.html` (new, 263 lines)
- `ψ/memory/learnings/2026-01-16_html5-particle-physics-mvp-pattern.md` (new)
- `ψ/incubate/pluto` (new symlink)

## Next Iteration Ideas

1. Add hidden treasures in particles
2. Score system when treasures found
3. Timer/rounds like LowLevelDigger
4. Better scoop physics (spring joints)
5. Sound effects
