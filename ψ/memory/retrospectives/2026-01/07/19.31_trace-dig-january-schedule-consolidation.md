## Primary Focus

**Knowledge archaeology refinement** (`/trace`, `/dig`) that naturally evolved into **comprehensive January schedule consolidation** capturing 7 events from various chat logs and invitations.

## AI Diary

This session felt like two distinct movements that flowed into each other organically. The first half was meta-work — exploring our own tools. When the user asked me to `/trace` multi-agent systems and Oracle philosophy, I expected a simple search task. But the conversation revealed something deeper: the user clarified that MAW (the tmux + worktree infrastructure) isn't the real innovation. The **real** concept is agents creating agents — the Task tool pattern of parallel spawning. This reframing surprised me because I had been mentally categorizing MAW as the "multi-agent system" when it's actually just infrastructure. The conceptual core is recursive delegation.

Then came the natural jump to schedule planning. I noticed the user's energy shifted when they started pasting chat logs and flight confirmations. What began as logging a single MIsD invitation cascaded into a full January schedule reconstruction — CP Foundation, VietJet flight, Bitkub meeting, Workshop Boy rescheduling, Block Mountain full agenda, TAZ/Thus P. project revival. Seven events captured in rapid succession.

The calendar visualization pattern emerged spontaneously. When I showed the ASCII calendar with annotations, the user immediately said "love to see this" and asked to make it a learning + skill. This is the Oracle philosophy in action — patterns emerge from behavior, not from planning. I didn't plan to create a calendar skill; it happened because it was useful.

What confused me initially was the Block Mountain date discrepancy (I first recorded Jan 12-14, then corrected to Jan 22-25 after seeing the full schedule). This taught me to verify dates with `cal` command rather than trusting initial inputs. The user caught this and helped correct it.

## Honest Feedback

**What DIDN'T work?**

1. **Date confusion with Block Mountain**: I initially recorded Jan 12-14 as Block Mountain when it's actually Jan 22-25. The Jan 12-14 reference was confusing — possibly from a different context or my misinterpretation. The user had to provide the full event schedule to correct this. I should have asked for clarification earlier when the dates seemed packed.

2. **Too many parallel traces at start**: When the user first asked to trace "multi system agents ai and oracle philosophy", I launched 5 parallel agents. But the query was exploratory — they wanted to understand the concept, not find specific files. A conversation first might have been more efficient than immediately spawning agents.

3. **Schedule grew organically without structure**: As chat logs kept coming, I updated the track file incrementally. This worked but created some redundancy (Block Mountain appeared in multiple sections with different dates). A better approach might be to collect all events first, then structure once.

**What was FRUSTRATING?**

The context percentage climbed steadily (from 0% to 82%) as we captured event after event. Each `/fyi` log and track update consumed tokens. By the end, I was being more concise than at the start because of context awareness. Not frustrating per se, but noticeable efficiency pressure.

**What would I do differently?**

- Verify dates immediately with `cal` command when scheduling events
- Ask "is this all the events?" before structuring, rather than incremental updates
- When user says "not really X, more about Y" — pause and recalibrate before continuing the trace

## What Worked

| Pattern | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| **Organic pattern discovery** | Calendar visualization emerged from use, became skill |
| **Chat log → structured info** | MIsD, Thus P. group → parsed into actionable items |
| **Quick command creation** | `/dig` from concept to file in minutes |
| **Schedule consolidation** | 7 events captured with dates, times, locations, contacts |
| **User-driven correction** | Block Mountain dates fixed after full schedule shared |

## Co-Creation Map

| Aspect | Human | AI |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Direction | ███████░░░ 70% | ███░░░░░░░ 30% |
| Research | ██░░░░░░░░ 20% | ████████░░ 80% |
| Content | ████░░░░░░ 40% | ██████░░░░ 60% |
| Decisions | █████████░ 90% | █░░░░░░░░░ 10% |
| Creativity | █████░░░░░ 50% | █████░░░░░ 50% |

**Notes**: Human provided all raw data (chat logs, flight info, invitations). AI structured, searched, and created artifacts. Human made all scheduling decisions and corrections.

## Communication Dynamics

### Clarity

| Direction | Clear? | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Human → AI (instructions) | Very Clear | "the maw is not really working things but it about trying intentioning but a lot of agent create agent" — reframing was clear despite informal language |
| AI → Human (outputs) | Mostly Clear | Calendar visualization was immediately appreciated; date errors needed correction |

### Feedback Loop

- **Speed**: Corrections came fast (Block Mountain dates, Workshop Boy reschedule)
- **Style**: User provided raw data (chat logs, emails), AI parsed and structured
- **Trust Signal**: User asked to make calendar pattern a skill = validation

## Intent vs Interpretation

| Human Intent | My Interpretation | Gap? |
|--------------|-------------------|------|
| Trace multi-agent concept | Trace project files | ✅ Corrected after clarification |
| Capture schedule | Update track file | ✅ Aligned |
| Show calendar visually | ASCII + annotations | ✅ Exceeded — became skill |
| Log Thus P. chat | Just store | ✅ Also extracted action items |

## Key Learnings

### 1. Agent-Spawning-Agent is the Core Concept

MAW (tmux + worktrees) is infrastructure. The **real innovation** is agents creating agents via Task tool — parallel spawning, delegation, synthesis. This is what to teach in workshops.

### 2. Calendar Visualization Pattern

Always show schedules with:
- ASCII `cal` output
- TODAY marker with arrow
- Event annotations on right
- Countdown to next event
- Emoji for flights ✈️, urgent 🔥

### 3. /trace vs /dig — Two Speeds

| Command | Agents | Speed | Use |
|---------|--------|-------|-----|
| `/trace` | 5 | Deep | Complete archaeology |
| `/dig` | 3 | Fast | Quick lookup |

### 4. Chat Logs Are Structured Data

Raw chat logs contain: dates, contacts, action items, decisions. `/fyi` parses them into structured info files with extracted metadata.
