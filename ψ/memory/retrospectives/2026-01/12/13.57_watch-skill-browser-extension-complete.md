## AI Diary

This was a deeply satisfying building session. Started from a simple idea - "learn from YouTube videos" - and built a complete pipeline: yt-dlp extracts metadata and CC, Gemini transcribes/summarizes, Oracle indexes the knowledge.

The extension evolution was rapid: v1.5.3 → v1.6.0 (select_model) → v1.6.1 (fix selector) → v1.6.2 (debug info) → v1.7.0 (UI pills). Each iteration was driven by real testing - the user would try, find issues, and we'd fix. This tight feedback loop made progress fast.

The "aha moment" was when the model selector pills worked. Clicking ⚡Fast and seeing Gemini switch models instantly - that's the kind of UI that makes tools feel alive.

## What We Built

### /watch Skill
YouTube → Gemini → Oracle knowledge pipeline

**Scripts**:
- `get-metadata.sh` - yt-dlp JSON (title, duration, channel)
- `get-cc.sh` - yt-dlp SRT subtitles
- `save-learning.sh` - Save to ψ/memory/learnings/

### claude-browser-proxy v1.7.0
Chrome extension upgrades:

| Version | Feature |
|---------|---------|
| v1.6.0 | select_model command |
| v1.6.1 | Fix selector |
| v1.6.2 | Debug info in response |
| v1.7.0 | Model pill UI in sidepanel |

---

## Technical Learnings

1. **Selector for Gemini model**: `button.input-area-switch` works
2. **ref clicks > coordinate clicks**: Gemini UI shifts, refs are stable
3. **MQTT needs sidepanel open**: Extension must be active to receive
4. **yt-dlp is powerful**: Metadata, CC, all without downloading video

## Videos Transcribed

| Video | Channel | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Never Gonna Give You Up | Rick Astley | ✅ Saved |
| Neural Networks Ch.1 | 3Blue1Brown | ✅ Saved |
| ESP32-S3 TFT | Adafruit | ✅ Testing |

## Honest Feedback

The session was productive but hit context limit. Should have:
- Started with simpler test video
- Committed extension changes more atomically
- Written retrospective earlier

The /watch skill is genuinely useful - transforms passive YouTube watching into active knowledge building. The extension UI makes it accessible without CLI.

**Highlight**: Seeing "1.7.0" badge on extension and model pills actually working.

## Next Steps

1. Push extension to repo
2. Add auto-save after Gemini response
3. Integrate CC cross-check into prompt
4. Add language selection for CC
