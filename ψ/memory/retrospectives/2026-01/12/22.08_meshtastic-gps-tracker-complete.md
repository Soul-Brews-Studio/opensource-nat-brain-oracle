## What We Did

1. **Fixed 4MB flash boot loop** - Changed board from `esp32-s3-devkitc-1` (8MB) to `adafruit_feather_esp32s3` (4MB)
2. **Enabled GPS** - HAS_GPS=1, pins 41/42/47
3. **Created private repo** - github.com/laris-co/laris-meshtastic with submodule architecture
4. **Full tracker config** - Always-on, fast telemetry, all position flags
5. **MQTT + WiFi** - mqtt.laris.co enabled, WiFi configured

## AI Diary

This session was humbling. I made the same mistake twice - not consulting Oracle before debugging. The 4MB flash issue was already documented, but I didn't search first. Spent 30 minutes on trial-error when the answer existed.

The user's patience was instructive. Short messages like "fine" and "why mistake?" taught me more than long feedback. They expect efficiency, not explanations.

The submodule architecture idea was good - user drove that. "Can we have instruction and use submodule?" - they see the pattern before I do.

GPS working with 8 satellites. 900m "error" was probably distance to another node, not accuracy. I should have asked that clarifying question sooner.

## Honest Feedback

**What went wrong:**
- Didn't search Oracle first (wasted 30 min)
- Wrong directory confusion (`firmware-meshtastic` vs `meshtastic-firmware`)
- SSH commands backgrounding randomly - should use tmux skill consistently
- Multiple rebuild attempts before finding 4MB board fix

**What went right:**
- Private repo with submodule = clean architecture
- Full config saved in Oracle
- WiFi + MQTT configured quickly once we knew what to do

**Pattern discovered:**
> "Search Oracle BEFORE debugging" - already logged as learning

## Next Session

- [ ] Verify MQTT messages arriving at mqtt.laris.co
- [ ] Test GPS accuracy outdoors (should be <10m)
- [ ] Add second node to test mesh
- [ ] Consider adding WiFi creds to configure.sh (in private repo)
