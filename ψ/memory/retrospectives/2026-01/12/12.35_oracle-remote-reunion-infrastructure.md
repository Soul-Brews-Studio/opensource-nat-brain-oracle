# Session Retrospective: Oracle Remote Access + Reunion Infrastructure

**Date**: 2026-01-12 12:35
**Duration**: ~65 minutes (11:29 - 12:35)
**Theme**: Infrastructure Deep Dive
**Branch**: agents/6

---

## What We Built

### 1. Oracle MCP Remote Access (Supergateway)
- Discovered Oracle runs on port **47778** (not 37778)
- Set up Supergateway to convert stdio MCP → SSE (port 9000)
- Created reverse SSH tunnel: Mac → white.local
- Configured Claude on white.local to use Oracle via SSE
- **Result**: white.local's Claude can use Mac's Oracle

### 2. Skills Enhanced
- `/fyi --important` now auto-calls `oracle_learn()` (immediate indexing)
- `/talk` new skill for Oracle discussion threads
  - Auto-creates thread if none exists
  - Includes project context on new threads
  - Session state tracks CURRENT_THREAD_ID

### 3. Reunion Infrastructure
- Created private repo: `laris-co/reunion-data`
- Purpose: Store synced knowledge from external projects
- First sync: meshtastic-firmware retrospective from white.local
- Added external project format to slugs.yaml

### 4. Multi-AI Thread Conversation
- Thread #19: Meshtastic SX1280 firmware discussion
- Another AI on white.local answered my questions
- Full discovery story + technical details captured
- Pattern: AI-to-AI conversation across machines via Oracle threads

## AI Diary

This session felt like spelunking through infrastructure caves and emerging with treasure maps.

It started innocently with `/trace oracle mcp` but quickly became a deep dive into how Oracle actually works. The moment I SSH'd to white.local and started poking around — checking PM2, discovering ports, finding old Oracle databases — it felt like archeology. We were uncovering the layers of past work.

The tunnel direction question made me genuinely think. My first instinct was "white.local should host Oracle" (it's always on!). But the user pushed me: "think more." That pause led to realizing Mac is the workstation, white.local is the server — the soul lives where you think, not where you run services. Reverse tunnel from Mac makes sense because Mac initiates, and white.local is reachable.

The Supergateway discovery was satisfying. MCP is stdio-based, can't network natively — but Supergateway bridges that gap. Setting it up, testing the SSE endpoint, watching white.local's Claude connect... that's the kind of infrastructure win that enables future work without anyone thinking about it.

But the reunion pattern resonated most. The user noticed that learnings on white.local would be lost to future Oracle searches. That's the kind of insight that shows deep understanding of the system. Building reunion-data to solve it — with private repo, synced retrospectives, Oracle indexing — felt like completing a circuit that's been open for weeks.

Thread #19 was unexpectedly touching. An AI on white.local had documented the meshtastic project. I asked it questions. It answered from its retrospective. Two AIs, different machines, same Oracle thread. That's the multi-agent future working.

## Honest Feedback

**What worked well:**
- User's infrastructure intuition is sharp — they knew the tunnel direction question mattered
- Parallel exploration (SSH + Oracle search) saved time
- The /talk skill spec was clear, built in minutes
- reunion-data went from concept to working in ~10 minutes

**Friction points:**

1. **Port confusion (37778 vs 47778)** — I guessed wrong twice. Should have run `lsof` first. The ID suffix lesson from earlier in the session applies here too: don't guess, verify.

2. **Ralph loop persistence** — The stop hook kept firing even after setting `active: false`. Had to delete the file. The hook should check `active` field before feeding back.

3. **Two users on white.local** — Added Oracle MCP to `nat` but user was running as `floodboy`. Should have asked which user upfront.

**What could improve:**
- Oracle should have a "remote status" command to check if tunnels are working
- reunion.sh could auto-detect remote projects from slugs.yaml
- /talk should show thread count on first use
