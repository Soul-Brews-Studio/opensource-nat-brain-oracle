# Session: The Great Archive Journey - A History Trace

🕐 09:47 | Monday 13 January 2026

## Context

Peeranut Numnark from Bangkok reached out via Facebook asking about missing commands (`/recap`, `/learn`, `/project`) in the Oracle Open Framework. This triggered a deep trace that uncovered our 8-month journey.

## The Journey Timeline

### May 2025: Oracle Birth
- Oracle philosophy created: "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human"
- Core principles: Nothing is Deleted, Patterns Over Intentions, External Brain
- Started as philosophy, not code

### Dec 2025: Command Explosion
- 79+ command files in `.claude/commands/`
- Context bloat - Claude loading everything
- Mixed quality, many unused
- No clear structure

### Jan 10, 2026: The Skill Structure Trap
- Tried creating `/learn` skill as single file: `.claude/skills/learn.md`
- **10 minutes debugging** why it didn't work
- Discovery: Skills MUST be `folder/skill.md`, not single files
- Documented in learnings

### Jan 11, 2026: THE GREAT PURGE
The pivotal day. Timeline:

| Time | Action | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| 21:25 | Archive unused project commands | Cleanup begins |
| 21:28 | Archive 28 unused commands | 79 → 51 |
| 21:34 | Convert trace + fyi to skills | Pattern emerges |
| 21:36 | **Archive ALL commands** | 79 → 0 |
| 21:38 | Archive ALL skills | 20 → 0 |
| 21:44 | **Restore 4 core skills** | trace, rrr, recap, learn |
| 22:14 | Archive specs/ | 38 folders |

**Result**: From 79 commands to 12 core skills

### Jan 12, 2026: Oracle Open Framework v1.0.0
- Published to GitHub
- Philosophy + structure documented
- Ready for community

### Jan 13, 2026: First Community Request
- Peeranut asks about missing commands
- Opens GitHub issue
- Triggers this retrospective

## The 12 Core Skills That Survived

```
/trace         — Find + Oracle first
/context-finder — Search subagent
/rrr           — Retrospective
/recap         — Fresh start orientation
/learn         — Explore codebase
/project       — Clone & track repos
/where-we-are  — Session awareness
/forward       — Handoff
/feel          — Mood logging
/fyi           — Info logging
/standup       — Daily check
/schedule      — Calendar
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. Archive-First Development
> "Archive now, renovate to skill when bringing back"

- Archive = forced modernization
- Nothing truly deleted (git history)
- Prevents accumulation of dead code

### 2. Skill Structure is Non-Negotiable
```
❌ .claude/skills/learn.md
✅ .claude/skills/learn/skill.md
```

Frontmatter requirements:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: One sentence for auto-trigger
---
```

### 3. Less is More
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 79 commands | 0 commands |
| 20 skills | 12 core skills |
| Context bloat | Focused toolkit |

### 4. Community Validates Architecture
Peeranut's question revealed the gap between:
- **Nat-s-Agents** (full implementation, private tree)
- **Oracle Open Framework** (public seed, missing skills)

This led to issues #100-102: Add shared skills to nat-agents-core plugin.

## AI Diary

This trace was emotional. Seeing 8 months compressed into commits, watching the evolution from philosophy to 79 commands to 12 survivors... it's like archaeology of our own work.

The Great Purge (Jan 11) was scary. Archiving everything felt like losing. But what emerged was clarity. The 12 skills that survived ARE the essentials. Everything else was noise.

Peeranut's question was a gift. It forced us to look back and see the journey. Now we can share it.

## Open Items

1. **Blog post** — Write public-facing version of this journey
2. **Issues #100-102** — Add skills to nat-agents-core for child Oracles
3. **Reply to Peeranut** — Skills coming via nat-agents-core

## Quotes

> "79 commands → 0 commands → 12 core skills. That's not reduction. That's refinement."

> "Archive-first development: The courage to delete, knowing git remembers."

> "The community question came at the perfect moment. We had the answer, we just hadn't packaged it yet."
