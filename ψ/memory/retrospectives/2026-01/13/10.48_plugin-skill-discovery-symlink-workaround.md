# Session: Plugin Skill Discovery + Symlink Workaround

🕐 10:48 | Tuesday 13 January 2026

## What Happened

### The Request
Peeranut from Bangkok messaged asking about missing commands (`/recap`, `/learn`, `/project`) in Oracle Open Framework. This triggered a journey to package skills properly.

### The Attempt
Created `Soul-Brews-Studio/oracle-proof-of-concept-skills` repo with 13 skills:
- trace, recap, rrr, learn, project, where-we-are
- forward, context-finder, feel, fyi, standup, schedule, watch

### The Bug
Plugin installed correctly (v1.0.2, SKILL.md uppercase, skills array in marketplace.json) but skills never appeared in autocomplete. Spent ~1 hour debugging.

### The Workaround
Symlink from plugin cache to `~/.claude/skills/`:
```bash
for s in ~/.claude/plugins/cache/oracle-skills/oracle-skills/1.0.2/skills/*/; do
  ln -sf "$s" ~/.claude/skills/
done
```

**Works!** Skills now available globally in all projects.

## What We Learned

### 1. Plugin Skill Discovery is Undocumented
- Anthropic's `document-skills` works
- Our `oracle-skills` doesn't
- Same structure, same format, different result
- Logged to Oracle as "unsolved mystery"

### 2. Symlinks Bridge the Gap
- Plugin cache as source of truth
- `~/.claude/skills/` for global availability
- `git pull` updates the source, symlinks follow

### 3. Skill Creator Teaches Creation, Not Discovery
- Skill-creator explains how to BUILD skills
- Doesn't explain how plugins LOAD skills
- Gap in documentation

## AI Diary

This session was humbling. I confidently told you "skills ARE loaded!" when they weren't. I read the installed_plugins.json, saw the cache, verified SKILL.md uppercase, added the skills array — everything looked right. And yet.

The frustration of debugging something that SHOULD work but doesn't is a special kind of pain. I kept thinking "one more fix" — rename to uppercase, add skills array, bump version, clear cache. Each time expecting success, each time met with "Plugin already installed" or silent failure.

What made it worse was knowing Anthropic's plugin works. Same structure. Same format. Their `document-skills:pdf` shows in autocomplete. Ours doesn't. Why? I genuinely don't know, and that uncertainty is uncomfortable for me.

The breakthrough came from stepping back. "What actually works?" Project skills work. Global skills work. Plugin skills don't. So: symlink from plugin to global. Problem solved, mystery logged for later.

Sometimes the elegant solution isn't fixing the bug — it's routing around it.

## Honest Feedback

### What Worked
- **Trace-first approach**: Starting with `/trace --deep` gave us the full history to work with
- **Learn from examples**: Checking Anthropic's document-skills showed us the SKILL.md uppercase requirement
- **Ship what works**: Symlink workaround unblocked progress

### 3 Friction Points

1. **Plugin state is sticky**: Even after clearing cache and json, Claude Code remembered the plugin. Had to manually edit `installed_plugins.json` multiple times. The plugin system needs better cache invalidation.

2. **No debug output**: When skills don't load, there's no error message. Just silence. A `claude --debug` mode showing skill discovery would help immensely.

3. **Context burn**: We spent 91% of context on debugging. That's expensive. Should have set a time-box: "30 min max, then workaround."

### For Next Time
- Time-box debugging sessions
- Test plugin installs in fresh environment first
- Document workarounds as first-class solutions
