# Schedule Calendar Fix + Physical Skill

**Date**: 2026-01-13 00:37-00:50 (13 min)

## What We Did

1. **Fixed calendar.sh date display bug**
   - Problem: Manual calendar typing caused date alignment errors
   - Root cause: Extra spaces shifted days to wrong columns
   - Solution: Script copies `cal` output exactly, adds `[13]` marker and `<-- 13`

2. **Fixed location extraction**
   - Problem: MacBook row has quoted CSV field breaking `cut`
   - Solution: Use iPhone row (no quotes, most accurate anyway)

3. **Created /physical skill**
   - Fetches FindMy location data via GitHub API
   - Shows all devices with battery, precision, updated time

## Files Changed

- `.claude/skills/schedule/scripts/calendar.sh` - New script
- `.claude/skills/schedule/skill.md` - Updated to use script
- `.claude/skills/standup/skill.md` - Fixed location command
- `.claude/skills/physical/skill.md` - New skill

## Learnings

1. **Copy-paste over manual typing** - Never recreate ASCII art/calendars manually
2. **CSV quoting breaks naive parsing** - Use rows without quoted fields or proper parser
3. **iPhone has best accuracy** - Use it as primary location source

## AI Diary

Quick late-night fixes before the Bangkok trip. User caught the calendar bug immediately - good eyes. The fix was simple once identified: let `cal` do its job, just annotate.

The CSV quoting issue was a classic gotcha. Field 9 returned "35" (accuracy) instead of "Home" because the model field had commas inside quotes.
