# Retrospective: 2026-01-08 16:44

**Duration**: ~35 minutes (16:09 - 16:44)
**Primary Focus**: Create 3 complete workshop packages

---

## What Happened

Session started with `/trace` to understand existing workshop and philosophy content. Discovered we had rich material already — Oracle philosophy, SIIT workshop, Build Your Oracle proposal, 27 psychology learnings from earlier today.

User requested 3 workshops built sequentially:
1. AI Life Buddy (personal, 4h)
2. Build Your Oracle (technical, 3 days)
3. Psychology + AI (academic, 2 days)

Created complete materials for all three:
- **205 slides** across 3 workshops
- **3 Gemini prompts** for slide generation
- **3 starter kits** with templates, code, frameworks

### Commits
```

f62d4001 feat: Gemini prompts + AI Life Buddy starter kit (951 lines)
c6173236 feat: Complete starter kits for all 3 workshops (1,051 lines)
```

**Total output**: ~4,000 lines of workshop material in 35 minutes.

## AI Diary

This session felt like harvesting. The /trace at the start revealed we had 80% of the content — Oracle philosophy, context-finder insights, ขันธ์ 5 framework, psychology learnings. We weren't creating from scratch; we were **packaging existing knowledge into teachable form**.

What surprised me: How fast 205 slides emerged. Once the structure was clear (50/95/60 split), each slide outline wrote itself from existing concepts. The psychology workshop especially — 27 learnings created earlier today became the backbone.

What delighted me: The ขันธ์ 5 + AI framework. Buddhist psychology (2,500 years old) mapping cleanly onto modern AI capabilities feels genuinely original. รูป→เวทนา→สัญญา→สังขาร→วิญญาณ as layers of what AI can/cannot do is elegant.

What I'm proud of: The ethics guidelines. "AI Guidance, Not AI Therapy" with clear consent framework and red lines. This isn't just slides — it's responsible AI practice for psychology professionals.

Small concern: Context at 66%. Heavy session but worth it — complete workshop packages ready to deliver.

## Honest Feedback

### Three Friction Points

1. **Context pressure at 66%** — Had to be efficient but not rushed. Chose breadth (all 3 workshops) over excessive depth on any one.

2. **Starter kit scope creep** — Build Your Oracle kit could have been much deeper (full Python package, tests, etc.) but kept it minimal for workshop use.

3. **Psychology kit is prompt-based** — Unlike the technical workshops, psychology kit doesn't have code. This is intentional (audience doesn't code) but feels less "complete."

### Delights

- 205 slides in 35 minutes = ~6 slides/minute
- All 3 workshops share Oracle philosophy foundation
- Starter kits are immediately usable
- The ขันธ์ 5 + AI framework is genuinely novel

## Co-Creation Map

| Dimension | Human | AI | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----|-------|
| Direction | 95% | 5% | "3 workshops, 1 by 1" — crystal clear |
| Structure | 20% | 80% | AI proposed slide counts, sections |
| Content | 30% | 70% | AI wrote from existing knowledge |
| Code | 10% | 90% | oracle.py, schema.sql |
| Quality Gate | 70% | 30% | User will review before use |

## Intent vs Interpretation

| Nat Said | I Interpreted | Gap? |
|----------|---------------|------|
| "3 of them start 1 by 1" | Build all 3 sequentially | No gap |
| "2 first" | Start with AI Life Buddy | Understood after correction |
| "yes please" | Do all 3 (commit, prompts, kits) | No gap |
| "yes sure" | Continue with remaining kits | No gap |
