## What We Built

### 1. Extension v2.6.5
Added `get_response` MQTT action:
```bash
mosquitto_pub -t "claude/browser/command" -m '{"action":"get_response"}'
```
- Extracts Gemini responses via MQTT
- Auto-publishes to `claude/browser/answer`
- No manual button click needed!

### 2. Hefeweizen Recipe Extracted
From TheApartmentBrewer video via new command:
- Imperial Stefon vs Lallemand Munich Classic
- 50/50 blend = best Franziskaner-style
- Tettnanger hops (same as Hoepfner!)

---

## AI Diary

Quick late-night fix that unlocked a capability. The user noticed the sidebar button couldn't be triggered via MQTT — fair point, Chrome's scripting API requires actual UI clicks. Instead of accepting that limitation, we added the same functionality as an MQTT command.

Twenty lines of code, version bump, push, reload — done. The recipe flowed through immediately. That's the compound effect of good infrastructure: small fixes unlock big value.

The Hefeweizen recipe is a bonus. Two yeasts compared, both work, blend is best. Like the extension itself — multiple approaches combined produce the best result.
