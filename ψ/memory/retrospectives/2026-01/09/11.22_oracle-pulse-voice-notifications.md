# Session Retrospective: Oracle Pulse Voice Notifications

**Date**: 2026-01-09
**Time**: ~10:47 - 11:22 (35 minutes)
**Primary Focus**: Voice notifications polish for Oracle Pulse

---

## What Happened

### Context
Continued from previous session that added MQTT voice notifications to Oracle Pulse. User reported:
1. Logs page was frozen
2. Voice notifications not triggering for new searches

### Work Done
1. **Debugged frozen Logs page** - Investigated background task outputs, found no errors. Fixed by restarting app (transient issue).

2. **Voice settings iterations**:
   - Started with Thai text + Kanya voice at rate 280
   - User wanted Samantha voice instead
   - Changed text to English: "[query] oracle found [N] results"
   - Adjusted rate to 250 for clearer speech

3. **Commits to oracle-status-tray**:
   - `34d2ca7` feat: English voice text + Samantha voice at rate 250

## AI Diary

This was a continuation session - picking up where the previous (compacted) session left off. The challenge was understanding what had already been done from the summary.

I felt a bit uncertain at first about the "frozen logs" issue. My instinct was to dive into code analysis, but the simpler solution (restart) worked. Sometimes the obvious fix is the right one.

The voice settings went through multiple iterations: Thai -> English, Kanya -> Samantha, rate 280 -> 250. Each change was small but the user knew exactly what they wanted. I appreciated the quick feedback loop - try something, hear it, adjust.

What worked well: The auto-rebuild feature of `cargo tauri dev` made iterations fast. Change code, app rebuilds in ~5 seconds, user can test immediately.

## Honest Feedback

### What Could Be Better
1. **Session continuity** - Reading compacted summaries takes time to orient. The summary was good but I still needed to re-read files to understand state.

2. **Voice notification architecture** - Currently only announces when Logs tab is open. User might want background notifications. Mentioned this but didn't implement.

3. **Testing** - Each voice change required manual testing. No automated way to verify MQTT messages are sent correctly.

### Friction Points
- Compacted context means some history is lost
- Multiple background tasks running made output harder to track
- Voice settings are hardcoded - could be user-configurable in UI

## Communication Dynamics

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Understood intent | 5/5 | Clear requests: "use samantha", "speed 250" |
| Response speed | 4/5 | Quick iterations, auto-rebuild helped |
| Verbosity | 4/5 | Kept responses short and focused |

| Testing | 80% | 20% |

## Intent vs Interpretation

| Human Said | I Interpreted | Gap |
|------------|---------------|-----|
| "the log page is freeze" | Logs tab not updating | None - correctly diagnosed |
| "we can use samantha" | Switch from Kanya to Samantha voice | None |
| "speed 250" | Change rate from 280 to 250 | None |
| "voice notification test oracle found 112 results" | This is the desired text format | None - updated accordingly |

---

## Key Outcomes

- Oracle Pulse now announces searches in Samantha voice at rate 250
- Text format: "[query] oracle found [N] results"
- Voice notifications enabled by default
- Logs page working after restart
