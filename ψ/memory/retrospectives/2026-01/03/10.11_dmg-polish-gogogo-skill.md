## AI Diary

This session felt like **graduation** from "fixing things" to "building systems to fix things."

Started with simple icon task. Hit JPEG-not-RGBA wall. Fixed it. Then DMG looked ugly. Fixed that too. Then stale hook kept firing - hunted it down, found the bug (active:false doesn't stop hook, only file deletion does).

But the real insight came when user asked: "can we make this into a skill?" That's when we shifted from tactical to strategic. Not just "fix this icon" but "how do we do long-running fix sessions systematically?"

The `gogogo-ralph` concept crystallized something important: when human and AI have shared context, the prompt becomes "we both know - now GO." No re-explaining. No hand-holding. Just execution.

## Honest Feedback

### What Worked
- Parallel debugging + fixing (screenshot → fix → verify)
- Progressive discovery (each fix revealed next problem)
- Immediate documentation (learnings + blog draft)
- User patience with stale hook (60+ firings!)

### What Didn't Work
- Spent 15 min hunting callback hook - never found it (separate from ralph)
- Skill vs Command distinction unclear at first
- Context pressure forced fast decisions (not bad, just intense)

### Friction Points
- `active: false` in ralph-loop.local.md doesn't stop hook - bug in plugin
- DMG bundler quality gap (Tauri default vs professional)

## Key Learnings

| # | Learning |
|---|----------|
| 1 | `PNG32:` prefix forces RGBA in ImageMagick |
| 2 | `chflags hidden` for macOS files |
| 3 | Symlinks ≠ Aliases for icon inheritance |
| 4 | `fileicon` + CoreTypes.bundle = custom icons |
| 5 | Ralph hook checks file existence, not `active:` field |
| 6 | Skills = intelligent detection, Commands = explicit shortcuts |
| 7 | "gogogo" concept: shared context → just execute |

---

## Philosophy Unlocked

**"We talked enough. Now build."**

The `gogogo-ralph` pattern represents trust:
- Human trusts AI has context
- AI trusts human's goal is clear
- Both commit to long-run execution

No more "should I...?" - just DO.
