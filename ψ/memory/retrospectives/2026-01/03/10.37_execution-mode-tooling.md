# Session Retrospective: Execution Mode Tooling

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Time**: 10:15 - 10:37 (~22 min)
**Primary Focus**: Creating longrun skill + gogogo command + /where-we-are

## Session Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | ~22 min |
| Context | Continued from handoff (DMG polish session) |
| Main Deliverables | 3 (skill + 2 commands) |

## What Happened

### Timeline

| Time | Topic | Jump |
|------|-------|------|
| 10:15 | Restore from handoff | - |
| 10:16 | Rename skill: deep-work → longrun → gogogo | 🔄 iterations |
| 10:20 | Remove "go long" from gogogo triggers | ✅ complete |
| 10:22 | Create `/longrun` command | ✅ complete |
| 10:24 | Final: skill=longrun, command=gogogo-ralph | ✅ complete |
| 10:26 | Philosophy: command vs skill distinction | 🌟 spark |
| 10:30 | /now - user says "too short" | 🌟 spark |
| 10:32 | /trace to find design patterns | 🔍 research |
| 10:35 | Create `/where-we-are` command | ✅ complete |
| 10:37 | rrr | ✅ complete |

**Pattern**: 5 ✅ completes, 2 🌟 sparks, 1 research — linear flow

## Key Deliverables

| Type | Name | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Skill | `longrun` | Marathon mode ("long run", "go long", "marathon") |
| Command | `/gogogo-ralph` | Quick execution with shared context |
| Command | `/where-we-are` | Full context awareness (deeper than /now) |

## AI Diary

This session was about **naming things** — the hardest problem in computer science.

Started with "deep-work" → felt too productivity-guru. Changed to "longrun" → user said gogogo should be separate. Then the insight: **commands assume shared context, skills confirm goal**.

The `/where-we-are` design came from user saying `/now` was "too short". Used /trace to explore existing designs (/now, /recap, /tracks, /pending). Found the gap: nothing for **mid-session full awareness**.

The naming iterations weren't wasted — they revealed the underlying concepts:
- `gogogo` = "we talked, now GO" (shared context)
- `longrun` = marathon mode (extended work)
- `/where-we-are` = "not just the clock, the map"

## Honest Feedback

### What Worked

| Aspect | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Fast iterations | 3 renames in 5 min, each clarifying |
| User precision | "gogogo not long run" — clear distinction |
| /trace for research | Found existing patterns to build on |

### Friction Points

1. **Initial confusion** — took 3 tries to understand gogogo ≠ longrun conceptually
2. **Too many renames** — could have asked clarifying question earlier

### Suggestions

- Ask "what's the difference?" earlier when concepts feel similar
- Use megathink for naming decisions

## Lessons Learned

| # | Learning |
|---|----------|
| 1 | Commands = shared context exists, GO immediately |
| 2 | Skills = detect trigger, confirm goal, then GO |
| 3 | `/now` = timeline only, `/where-we-are` = full map |
| 4 | Naming iterations reveal underlying concepts |
| 5 | User precision > AI assumptions |

## Philosophy Unlocked

**"We talked enough. Ship it."** — The gogogo philosophy

The distinction between:
- **gogogo-ralph**: "We have context. Execute."
- **longrun**: "This is a marathon. Confirm goal first."

This maps to real work patterns:
- Quick pairing session → gogogo
- Long solo work → longrun
