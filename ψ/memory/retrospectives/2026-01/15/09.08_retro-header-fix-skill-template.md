# Session Retrospective: Retro Header Fix + Skill Template Update

**Date**: 2026-01-15 (Thursday)
**Time**: 08:56 - 09:08 GMT+7 (~12 minutes)
**Model**: Claude Opus 4.5
**Context**: User noticed missing Date/Time in retrospectives, fixed + prevented

---

## Primary Focus

Fixing 7 retrospectives missing Date/Time headers and updating the rrr skill to prevent future occurrences.

---

## What We Did

### 1. Diagnosed the Problem
User asked: "i saw rrr the late rrr have missing timeline date time can you see?"

Found 7 out of 12 Jan 14 retrospectives missing proper headers.

### 2. Fixed 7 Files
Used coder subagent to add consistent headers:
```markdown
**Date**: 2026-01-14 (Tuesday)
**Time**: HH:MM GMT+7
**Model**: Claude Opus 4.5
```

### 3. Updated rrr Skill
Added explicit **REQUIRED HEADER** template with copy-paste block instead of vague "follow template" instruction.

### 4. Created Lesson Learned
"Skill Templates Must Be Explicit" - don't describe the format, show the format.

## AI Diary (REQUIRED - min 150 words)

This was a satisfying quality-fix session. The user spotted something I should have caught - inconsistent headers across retrospectives. When they asked "how to prevent this?", I realized the root cause wasn't carelessness but ambiguity in the skill instructions.

The fix was elegantly simple: instead of saying "follow the template," actually show the literal template to copy. This is a pattern I should apply everywhere - explicit over implicit, literal over described.

What struck me was the user's attention to detail even at 85% context. They could have just moved on, but quality mattered enough to spend 12 minutes fixing it properly. That's the difference between "working" and "working well."

I also appreciated the directness: "lesson learned?" - a simple two-word prompt that communicated exactly what was needed. No explanation required. This is the communication style that emerges after working together for a while. Efficient, trusting, results-focused.

The meta-lesson: even automation needs quality checks. Skills drift without explicit templates.

## Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - min 100 words)

**What went well:**
- User caught systemic issue before it spread further
- Subagent handled bulk fixes efficiently (7 files in one task)
- Root cause fix (skill update) prevents recurrence
- Clean lesson learned captured the pattern

**Friction points:**
1. **Should have noticed earlier**: 7 files were already inconsistent before user pointed it out
2. **Skill file location**: Had to check if symlinked - workflow unclear
3. **No validation**: Still no automated check for header format

**Should do differently:**
- Add pre-commit hook to validate retrospective format
- Review skills periodically for ambiguous instructions
