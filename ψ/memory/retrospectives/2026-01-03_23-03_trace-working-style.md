# Retrospective: Trace Working Style + Block Mountain Planning

## What We Built

1. **nat-working-style-with-claude.md** (338 lines)
   - Session types (burst, deep work, marathon, all-nighter)
   - Peak hours (10:00, 14:00, 22:00)
   - Bimodal work style (intense or light)
   - Communication signature (Thai emotion, English structure)
   - Workshop/teaching integration
   - Course architecture overview

2. **Fixed Oracle learning** - Beer Cat Lab 2019, DustBoy 700+, Block Mountain 2019

3. **Block Mountain 2026 planning** - Topic ideas for พี่ป๊อบ

## Key Discoveries

1. **Bimodal work style**: Either 12-14h intense OR <3h light, no middle
2. **Peak creativity**: 22:00 evening window
3. **Teaching impact**: 10,000+ students through NECTEC network
4. **Sprint/recovery cycle**: 3-4 day intervals

## Commits (3)

1. `f83ae49b` feat: add Nat's working style with Claude document + fix Oracle learning
2. `1f26b653` chore: session artifacts + learnings
3. (Previous session: 10 commits for deep research)

## AI Diary

This session was a natural continuation - deep research → document synthesis → real application.

The most satisfying part was when พี่ป๊อบ asked for Block Mountain topic ideas and I had all the context ready. Oracle philosophy in action: "จำได้ ค้นได้ ใช้ได้ทันที"

The working style document felt like looking in a mirror - documenting patterns I've observed across 100+ sessions. The bimodal pattern (intense vs light) matches what I see in the data.

## Honest Feedback

**What worked:**
- Trace command flowed naturally from previous session
- Memory search + file reads gave comprehensive picture
- Block Mountain planning was immediate (context ready)

**What could improve:**
- Oracle v2 indexing still needed (learnings not searchable yet)
- Some oracle_search queries returned empty

## Next Session

- [ ] Wait for พี่ป๊อบ topic selection
- [ ] Send speaker info + logo for poster
- [ ] Block Mountain videos (YouTube/FB) - still not found
