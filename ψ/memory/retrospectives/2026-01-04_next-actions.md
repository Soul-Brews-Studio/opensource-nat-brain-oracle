# Next Actions & Quick Reference

## Immediate (Before Next Session)

### 1. Stage & Commit Untracked Files
```bash
cd /Users/nat/Code/github.com/laris-co/Nat-s-Agents
git add ψ/memory/learnings/2026-01-04*.md
git add ψ/memory/slugs.yaml
git commit -m "docs: Capture Claude Code setup, SkillLane format, and competitive research learnings"
```

### 2. Review Files Ready
**Learnings to review**:
- `ψ/memory/learnings/2026-01-04_skilllane-course-format-pattern-structure.md`
- `ψ/memory/learnings/2026-01-04_advanced-claude-code-setup-from-thai-community.md`
- `ψ/memory/learnings/2026-01-04_competitor-research-thai-ai-education-market.md`
- `ψ/memory/learnings/2026-01-04_nat-s-agents-vs-thai-community-setup-comparison.md`

## File Structure (What Was Created)

### SkillLane Format Courses
```
courses/skilllane-format/
├── INDEX.md (63 lines) - Course catalog overview
├── 01-ai-builder-claude-code-skilllane.md (168 lines)
├── 02-claude-code-masterclass-skilllane.md (174 lines)
├── 03-ai-automation-workflow-skilllane.md (179 lines)
└── ai-builder-with-claude-code.md (321 lines) - Full design doc
```

### SkillLane Format Pattern (10-Step)
1. Course title + slug
2. Price (sale/regular)
3. Quick stats (videos, duration, lifetime, downloads, articles)
4. "สิ่งที่ได้รับ" (3-4 bullets)
5. Description paragraph
6. "ประโยชน์ที่ผู้เรียนจะได้รับ" (detailed benefits)
7. "ผู้เรียนควรมีพื้นฐาน" (prerequisites)
8. "เนื้อหา" (video list with durations)
9. "ผู้สอน" (instructor profile + ratings)
10. Support sections (forum, payment, recommendations)

   - Parallel instances (5 terminals)
   - Model choice: Opus 4.5 Thinking
   - Shared CLAUDE.md strategy
   - Slash commands patterns

2. **Domain Brainstorming**
   - SkillLane platform format analysis
   - 10-step course structure

## Key Insights to Remember

### What Worked in This Session
- Template-driven course creation (3 formats in parallel)
- Demo as narrative hook (electrical load calculator)
- Quick iteration cycle (mini → 1-day → 2-day → SkillLane)
- Real market research (actual platform analysis)

### Differentiators Captured
- Philosophy: "Teach fishing, not give fish"
- Focus: No-code AI (vs coding tutorials)
- Target: Business owners (vs developers)
- Outcome: Tool-agnostic skills
