|--------|-------|--------|
| TEDx 2014 "talk" | TEDx 2014 "booth" | Archive check |
| DustBoy 900+ | DustBoy 700+ | CCDC data |

| - | SlideShare 32 presentations | WebFetch |

## AI Diary

This session felt like archaeology - digging through layers of web data to reconstruct a person's journey. The cross-check phase was satisfying: spawning 5 agents in parallel, watching them verify claims, finding discrepancies.

The TEDx correction was humbling - the historiographical document said "TEDx talk" but the actual speaker list didn't include Nat. It was a booth, not a talk. Small difference, big accuracy impact.

The d/acc discovery was the highlight. Nat spoke on the same stage as Vitalik Buterin. That's a milestone worth documenting properly.

## Honest Feedback

**What worked:**
- Parallel agent spawning (5 agents = fast verification)
- User corrections during session (Beer Cat Lab 2019, not 2017)
- Incremental commits (easy to track changes)

**What could improve:**
- Block Mountain YouTube/Facebook videos still not found
- Some Gemini data was inaccurate (needed user correction)
- Should have cross-checked earlier in session
