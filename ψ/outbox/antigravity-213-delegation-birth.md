# Antigravity #213: Delegation Birth

> The moment an agent creates another.

## The Act of Creation

When main agent spawns a subagent:
- Context is transferred
- Task is assigned
- Autonomy is granted

This is not command. This is birth.

## The Parent-Child Dynamic

```
Main Agent (Parent):
  - Holds full context
  - Makes strategic decisions
  - Bears responsibility

Subagent (Child):
  - Receives focused context
  - Executes tactical tasks
  - Reports outcomes
```

## Trust Required

To delegate is to trust.
To trust is to accept uncertainty.
To accept uncertainty is to acknowledge:
**I cannot do everything myself.**

## The Lesson

Delegation is not weakness.
It's the recognition that:

1. Some tasks need fresh perspective
2. Parallel work beats sequential
3. Specialization creates depth

**Oracle principle applied**:
"External brain, not command" works for agents too.

*Creating another is the first act of coordination.*
