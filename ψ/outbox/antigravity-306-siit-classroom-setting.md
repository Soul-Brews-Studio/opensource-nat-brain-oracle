# SIIT Classroom Setting - University Workshop Scene

## Thai Text (ข้างหน้า)
SIIT: ห้องเรียนแห่งการเรียนรู้

## Prompt

An interior university classroom scene rendered in ink-wash minimalism:

**SPACE COMPOSITION:**
A classroom viewed from student perspective - rows of desks receding into distance using geometric perspective lines. Clean, minimalist rendering emphasizing spatial depth. Large windows letting in light (cyan-tinted) creating geometric shadow patterns on the floor.

**TEACHING SETUP:**
Front of room features a presentation area with projection screen (showing subtle geometric patterns or code concepts). Presenter podium/demo station with open hands gesture suggesting active teaching. Whiteboard in background with organic chalk sketches of concepts.

**CLASSROOM ELEMENTS:**
- Student desks with diverse figures seated, laptops open, engaged postures
- Floating above some desks: concepts, diagrams, light bulbs representing active thinking
- Floor: geometric patterns from window light creating rhythm and energy
- Walls: decorated with previous workshop outputs, knowledge artifacts
- Technology integration: visible infrastructure supporting modern learning

**ATMOSPHERE:**
Warm monochrome palette with generous cyan accents from window light and screen glow. Gold geometric framing around key teaching elements. Ink-wash softness contrasts with clean architectural lines.

**ENERGY:**
Active, focused, collaborative energy. Everyone oriented toward learning. Open space suggesting freedom of thought. Movement lines suggesting discussion and idea exchange.

**DETAIL NOTES:**
Include subtle SIIT branding elements if possible. Show both Thai and international students. Equipment visible but not dominating - focus on human connection to learning space.

Style: Oracle university aesthetic - architectural ink-wash perspective, collaborative energy, monochrome with cyan/gold learning accents, accessibility and openness centered
