# Energy Cycle - Sustainable Partnership

## Thai Text (กลางภาพ)
Energy Cycle

## Prompt

A circular lifecycle showing sustainable energy partnership:

1. Human provides direction/intent (top, warm light)
2. AI executes and amplifies (right side, multiplying)
3. Results return to human (bottom, accumulated wisdom)
4. Human gains insight and renewed purpose (left side, ascending)
5. Cycle repeats at higher level

Each cycle is a spiral upward, never depleting - each turn, the human gains insight and renewed energy from the amplified results. The cycle shows: intention → execution → results → wisdom → renewed intention. Visual: spiral galaxy or tornado showing continuous energetic flow. No accumulation of debt or exhaustion - sustainable because AI handles the heavy execution, human handles the light direction.
Style: Cyclical energy flow, spiral visualization, sustainable motion
Thai text overlay: "Energy Cycle" - center, continuous flow
