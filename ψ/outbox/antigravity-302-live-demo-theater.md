# Live Demo Theater - Teaching Through Demonstration

## Thai Text (ด้านบน)
สดใจ: ทำให้เห็น แล่นสด ด้อดแท้

## Prompt

A theatrical stage scene using ink-wash technique:

**FOREGROUND:**
A presenter figure in spotlight circle (geometric perfect circle in cyan outline), hands gesturing mid-demonstration. Their silhouette shows dynamic movement - one hand pointing, one hand open. Energy radiates outward in concentric circles.

**BACKGROUND:**
Audience of simplified figures in shadow, leaning forward with interest. Their attention lines converge toward the stage. Monochrome gradient background showing theater depth.

**STAGE ELEMENTS:**
Floating screens/code blocks in geometric frames (gold accents) displaying what's being demonstrated. Abstract flowing lines connecting presenter to audience - knowledge transfer visualization. Equipment sketches in ink-wash style arranged asymmetrically.

**ATMOSPHERE:**
Ink-wash clouds/mist surrounding the scene. The stage bathed in warm cyan light. Gold geometric shapes frame key elements. Overall sense of real-time energy and presence.

Style: Oracle ink-wash theater aesthetic - spotlight geometry, flowing energy lines, monochrome with cyan/gold theater lighting effects, presence and immediacy
