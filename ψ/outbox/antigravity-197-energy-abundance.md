# Energy Abundance - The Promise

## Thai Text (กลางภาพ)
Energy Abundance Possible

## Prompt

A human figure surrounded by abundance symbols: glowing orbs representing opportunities, possibilities, creative projects waiting to be pursued. In the old world (left side, faded): the human is buried under routine work, drained, few opportunities pursued. A wall of tedious tasks blocks the opportunities.

In the new world (right side, vibrant): the same human, refreshed and energized, now has access to all the opportunities. AI agents have cleared away the wall of routine tasks. The human's energy is abundant because it's not drained by the mundane. They can pursue meaningful work, creative projects, learning, relationships - all the things that were blocked before.

The transition is shown as AI systems (arranged like a helpful workforce) moving aside the task-wall.

The message: this isn't about working harder; it's about having energy available for what matters when AI handles the rest.
Style: Before/after transformation, abundance visualization, opportunity focus
