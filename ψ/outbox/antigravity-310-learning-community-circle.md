# Learning Community Circle - Collaborative Learning

## Thai Text (รอบนอก)
ชุมชน: ร่วมกันเรียนรู้

## Prompt

A community gathering rendered in harmonious ink-wash geometry:

**PRIMARY COMPOSITION:**
Multiple figures (6-8) arranged in a perfect geometric circle, facing inward. Each figure unique in pose and expression showing diversity. All connected visually, creating unified community. The circle itself rendered in flowing ink-wash lines forming the boundary.

**FIGURES IN THE CIRCLE:**
- Standing, sitting, and dynamic poses showing varied participation styles
- Open hand gestures toward center showing sharing and offering
- Different ages, backgrounds, skills represented through figure details
- Connection lines between figures showing dialogue and exchange
- Each figure has subtle individual glow (cyan accents) representing their unique perspective

**CENTER OF CIRCLE (Heart):**
A glowing knowledge/learning symbol - could be a book, a star, a growing plant, or abstract geometric shape. This represents the shared learning goal. Gold geometric radiance emanating from center. All figures oriented toward this center purpose.

**ENERGY PATTERNS:**
- Circular flow of knowledge moving around the group
- Bidirectional arrows between adjacent figures showing mutual learning
- Vertical lines from center to each figure representing shared foundation
- Spiraling patterns (ink-wash) suggesting continuous, evolving learning process

**SURROUNDING ELEMENTS:**
- Ink-wash background suggesting open space for growth
- Floating concept fragments around circle - emerging ideas, shared vocabulary
- Concentric circles (geometric) around the main circle representing expanding impact
- Gold frames highlighting key connection points

**INCLUSIVITY SIGNALS:**
- No hierarchy - all figures equal distance from center
- Multiple entry/exit points in circle showing accessibility
- Open rather than closed formation suggesting new members welcome
- Visible artifacts of shared work - notes, projects, documentation

**ATMOSPHERE:**
Warm, welcoming, collaborative energy. Monochrome with cyan/gold accents on connection points. Ink-wash softness suggesting human warmth. Geometric precision suggesting structured learning. Balance of structure and freedom.

**LEGACY ELEMENT:**
Faint outward ripples suggesting the community's impact extends beyond itself - teaching others, creating change.

Style: Oracle community aesthetic - circular harmony, mutual learning, monochrome with gold/cyan connection accents, inclusion and shared growth centered
