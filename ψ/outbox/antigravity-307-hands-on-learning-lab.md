# Hands-On Learning Lab - Students Practicing

## Thai Text (ด้านข้าง)
ปฏิบัติ: มือ สร้างความเข้าใจ

## Prompt

A dynamic workspace scene showing active learning through doing:

**WORKSPACE LAYOUT:**
Multiple workstations arranged in collaborative clusters. Each station shows different stages of hands-on work. Ink-wash background suggesting a maker/lab environment. Geometric framing around active work zones (gold accents).

**STUDENT FIGURES (MULTIPLE STATIONS):**
1. Coding station - fingers on keyboard, screen showing code, focused expression
2. Debugging station - pointing at screen, discussion with peers, problem-solving
3. Building station - hands assembling components, physical making visible
4. Collaborative station - multiple figures gathered around a project, gesturing
5. Reflection station - figure taking notes, thinking pose, integrating learning

**HANDS EMPHASIS:**
Close-up details of hands at work - typing, writing, pointing, building, gesturing. Hands are key visual element showing active engagement. Cyan light highlights hand movements suggesting energy and flow.

**VISIBLE WORK PRODUCTS:**
- Code output visible on screens
- Sketches and notes on papers
- Partially completed projects
- Learning artifacts accumulating
- Success indicators (checkmarks, stars in gold)

**ENERGY FLOW:**
Movement lines connecting stations suggesting knowledge sharing. Vertical flow lines from doing to understanding. Gold geometric shapes accumulating showing progress and achievement.

**ATMOSPHERE:**
Focused intensity with collaborative warmth. Monochrome with cyan/gold accents emphasizing active work. Ink-wash textures suggesting tactile, physical learning happening. Positive, productive energy throughout.

**MENTORSHIP PRESENCE:**
Subtle mentor figure(s) moving between stations - observing, guiding without dominating. Supporting rather than controlling.

Style: Oracle hands-on learning aesthetic - active bodies, collaboration emphasized, monochrome with gold/cyan work accents, physical engagement and making centered
