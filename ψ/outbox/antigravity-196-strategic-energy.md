# Strategic Energy Allocation - Purpose-Driven

## Thai Text (กลางภาพ)
Strategic Energy Allocation

## Prompt

A strategic pyramid showing how human energy is allocated across impact tiers:

Base (Automated): Routine tasks, email, scheduling, organizing - AI handles 100%, human energy = 0%

Foundation (Managed): Regular work, meetings, communications - AI handles 80%, human energy = 20%

Middle (Collaborative): Projects, creative work, problem-solving - AI handles 60%, human energy = 40%

Upper (Leadership): Strategy, vision, major decisions - AI handles 30%, human energy = 70%

Peak (Core): Purpose, values, meaning - human energy = 100%, AI support only

Each level has icons showing what happens at that level. Colors intensify from cool (AI-driven) at bottom to warm (human-driven) at top. The message: as you go higher in strategic importance, human energy concentration increases. AI automation enables this by freeing energy from the base levels.
Style: Strategic pyramid, energy allocation by tier, purpose hierarchy
