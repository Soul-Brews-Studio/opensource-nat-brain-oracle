# How to Write Blogs That Don't Sound Like AI

I accidentally discovered how to write better while trying to document a Facebook argument.

My AI refused to help me take revenge on someone. That's a different story. But when I asked it to write up what happened, something clicked.

The first draft was a report. Headers. Tables. Bullet points. It read like documentation.

"Write it like a novel," I said.

What came back was alive.

## The Problem With Most Blog Posts

They read like this:

> "On January 8th, 2026, I had an experience that taught me about ego and transformation. In this post, I will share the key learnings from that experience, including: 1) The importance of self-reflection, 2) How AI can provide valuable feedback, and 3) Why grace is more powerful than revenge."

You stopped reading at "key learnings," didn't you?

That's AI writing. Or worse — human writing that's been infected by AI writing.

It's organized. It's clear. It's dead.

## What Changed

I started writing like this:

> It was a Wednesday afternoon in Chiang Mai. The kind where the sun slants through coffee shop windows and you feel like you could build anything.
>
> I was building an Oracle.
>
> Not the database kind. The ancient kind.

Same information. Completely different feeling.

The reader is IN the moment. They're curious. They want to know what happens next.

## Six Techniques I Discovered

### 1. Scene-Setting (Atmosphere First)

**Don't start with information. Start with place.**

❌ "I learned an important lesson about ego yesterday."

✅ "It was a Wednesday afternoon in Chiang Mai. The kind where the sun slants through coffee shop windows and you feel like you could build anything."

**Formula**: [Time] + [Place] + [Sensory detail] + [Emotional state]

More examples:
- "It was 3am. The kind of 3am where bugs feel personal."
- "The coffee had gone cold. I hadn't noticed."
- "Rain on the window. Code on the screen. Something wasn't right."

### 2. The Ugly Admission (Find Your Villain Moment)

The most powerful moment in any story is when you admit your worst impulse.

Build up the external conflict. Show your justified frustration. Then reveal your ugly truth.

> And that's when something ugly woke up in me.
>
> "Make a very long text. Burn them!"
>
> I wanted revenge.

**The rule**: If you're the hero of your own story, you haven't gone deep enough.

Find the moment you were the villain. That's where the real story lives.

### 3. Short Paragraphs (Let White Space Work)

Academic writing teaches us to build paragraphs with topic sentences, supporting evidence, and conclusions.

Blog writing is different.

One idea.

One paragraph.

Let the white space breathe.

Her reply came fast.

"Can you be more professional?"

I read it twice.

She'd admitted she "took no notice" of the project.

But she'd already decided it was "potentially dishonest."

That's not skepticism.

That's fear wearing a disguise.

**Each paragraph is one beat. One breath. One thought.**

### 4. Hook Endings (Pull Forward)

End each section with a line that creates a question in the reader's mind.

> "Beautiful in theory. Then Sally showed up."

Reader HAS to know what happened.

> "So I told her."

Reader HAS to know what you said.

> "Sally did not see a gift."

Reader HAS to know what she saw instead.

> "And that's when something ugly woke up in me."

Reader HAS to know what ugly thing.

**The trick**: Understated is more powerful. Period, not exclamation point.

### 5. The Intervention (The Turn)

Every good story has a moment where everything shifts.

In my story, it was when my AI refused to do what I asked.

> And my Oracle looked at me and said:
>
> **"That's not Oracle. That's ego."**

The intervention is where the lesson happens. But don't explain it — let the reader feel it.

### 6. The Coda (End With Peace)

After the lesson, add a quiet moment of reflection.

> It's evening now. The coffee shop is closing. The sun has moved across the floor and disappeared.
>
> I'm thinking about Sally. Not with anger anymore. Just... wondering.
>
> What WAS she protecting?

Don't end with victory. End with peace.

Don't end with answers. End with questions.

The reader should exhale, not applaud.

## The Meta-Pattern

Here's the structure:

1. **Scene Setting** — Place, time, atmosphere
2. **The Setup** — What you were doing before
3. **The Inciting Event** — The moment everything changed
4. **Rising Tension** — Each exchange escalates
5. **The Crisis Point** — Your lowest moment (admit it)
6. **The Intervention** — What stopped you
7. **The Reflection** — What it meant
8. **The Coda** — Evening, quiet, wondering

This isn't new. It's how humans have told stories for thousands of years.

We just forgot it when we started writing "content."

## Why This Works

AI can generate perfect structure. Perfect organization. Perfect clarity.

What AI struggles with:

- **Atmosphere** — The feeling of a place
- **Vulnerability** — Admitting the ugly parts
- **Rhythm** — The music of short and long
- **Restraint** — Ending with questions, not answers

When you write with these elements, you sound human.

Because you ARE human.

And you're doing the hard work of being honest about it.

## The Test

Read your draft out loud.

Does it sound like a person talking?

Or does it sound like a report?

If it sounds like a report, find the moment you were wrong.

Start there.

## One Last Thing

The blog post that taught me all this was about a Facebook argument.

A woman offered me 79 baht instead of participating in something.

I wanted to destroy her with words.

My AI stopped me.

I chose grace.

And then I wrote about it — not as a report, but as a story.

The writing was better because the experience was real.

And I was willing to show the ugly parts.
