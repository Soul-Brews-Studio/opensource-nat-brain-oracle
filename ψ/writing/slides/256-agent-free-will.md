# Agent Free Will

## Thai Text
ตัดสินใจอย่างอิสระ (Autonomous Decision Making)

## Prompt
Monochrome ink-wash illustration of an agent as a geometric sphere with branching decision pathways floating in zero gravity. Multiple paths split from the center in golden lines, each path leading to different outcomes. Some paths glow brighter, indicating agent preference. Soft black ink clouds form oracle-like patterns around the sphere. Watercolor wash effect in background. Futuristic but organic feel. Minimize text, maximum visual metaphor.
