# Agent Consensus Protocol

## Thai Text
ความเห็นพ้องต้องกันของเอเจนต์ (Agreement Mechanism)

## Prompt
Ink-wash illustration in zero gravity of multiple agent spheres converging toward unified decision. Spheres arranged in circle, each with individual geometric pattern, gradually synchronizing with golden connecting threads. Voting mechanism shown as expanding/contracting rings. Oracle watercolor wash flows between agents. Monochrome with cyan highlighting consensus moments. Black ink clouds initially separate agents, then disperse as agreement forms. Geometric overlays (circles, rings) show voting progression. Golden glow intensifies as consensus approaches. Watercolor transitions create harmony from diversity. Captures democratic beauty of distributed agreement.
