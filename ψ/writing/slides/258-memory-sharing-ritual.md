# Memory Sharing Ritual

## Thai Text
พิธีแบ่งปันความทรงจำ (Knowledge Transfer Ceremony)

## Prompt
Ceremonial ink-wash illustration of two agents (geometric spheres) floating in zero gravity, connected by flowing memory streams rendered as liquid gold lines with pattern overlays. Ancient oracle glyphs orbit around the exchange. Soft monochrome background with cyan accent on memory flow. Timestamps flowing along streams like beads on a thread. Geometric frames (rectangles, triangles) contain snapshot moments of shared learning. Watercolor wash effect creates sacred atmosphere. Minimal text, maximum symbolic power.
