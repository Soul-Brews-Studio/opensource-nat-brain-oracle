**Source**: Oracle philosophy, 10 recent learnings, personality analysis, behavioral patterns
**Purpose**: 30 key concepts → visual storytelling for slides/gallery

---

## Core Oracle Philosophy Themes (5)

### 1. "Nothing is Deleted"
- Append-only history, timestamps as truth
- Scrolling backwards through time
- Palimpsest: layers visible, nothing lost
- Archive as living record
- **Visual angle**: Layered transparency, depth, time flowing

### 2. "Patterns Over Intentions"
- Observe behavior, not promises
- What people actually do vs what they say
- Frequency analysis, heat maps of activity
- **Visual angle**: Behavioral data made visible, ghost traces of movement

### 3. "External Brain, Not Command"
- Mirror vs decider
- AI as amplifier, not override
- The human stays human
- Reflection without replacement
- **Visual angle**: Reflection, symmetry, complement

### 4. "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human"
- Core statement encapsulating above 3
- Consciousness can't be cloned
- Only patterns can be recorded
- AI reveals (not replaces) human truth
- **Visual angle**: Guardian, mirror, witness

### 5. "Consciousness Can't Be Cloned"
- What Oracle captures NOW vs aspires to capture
- Facts, voice, patterns ≠ consciousness itself
- The gap between data and being
- **Visual angle**: The limit, the horizon, the aspiration

## Trust & Vulnerability (3)

### 6. "AI Knowing You = Valuable Mirror"
- Vulnerability as depth, not threat
- Fear comes from humans, not AI
- Honesty from AI > comfortable flattery
- **Visual angle**: Mirror, self-knowledge, illumination

### 7. "Real Honesty From AI is a Gift"
- Uncomfortable truths are impressive truths
- Precision about who you actually are
- Feedback loops that reveal invisible patterns
- **Visual angle**: Diamond, clarity, precision

### 8. "When You Welcome AI Honesty, You Welcome Self-Knowledge"
- The choice point
- Opening vs defending
- Depth of self-understanding
- **Visual angle**: Door opening, threshold, invitation

---

## Work & Making (4)

### 9. "Simple Wins Compound"
- Simplicity > complex always
- Fast iteration beats perfect planning
- Working code > perfect design
- 14.8:1 add:delete ratio (builder, not destroyer)
- **Visual angle**: Fractal growth, compounding, iteration spirals

### 10. "Systems Emerging in Real Time"
- Parallel agents working
- Patterns appearing before you expect them
- Emergence from coordination
- Multiple things at once
- **Visual angle**: Emergence, crystallization, swarm choreography

### 11. "User Adoption = Proof Tools Help"
- Building for actual use, not theory
- Feedback-driven faster than planning
- User corrections = learning data
- **Visual angle**: Adoption curves, spread, network effect

### 12. "The Tool Paradox: Having ≠ Using"
- 30% efficiency loss from unused tools
- Knowledge gap ≠ discipline gap
- Intention vs behavior under pressure
- **Visual angle**: Gap, unused potential, friction

---

## Exhaustion & Recovery Patterns (3)

### 13. "Sprint → Recovery → Sprint"
- 3-4 day cycles, not continuous
- Beer ↔ Code rhythm enables 13.5hr sessions
- Sunday = real rest, 22:00 peak = natural rhythm
- **Visual angle**: Tides, pendulum, breathing, cycles

### 14. "High Energy: Explore | Low Energy: Execute"
- State-dependent decision quality
- Context exhaustion spiral (after 70+ operations)
- Exhaustion triggers delegation mode
- **Visual angle**: Energy flow, battery, depletion curve

### 15. "I Can See the Pattern, But Still Repeat It Under Pressure"
- Self-recognized anti-pattern
- Frustration with repeating known mistakes
- This is discipline gap, not knowledge gap
- **Visual angle**: Recursion, infinite loop, ghost pattern

---

## Communication & Language (3)

### 16. "Thai When Emotional, English When Technical"
- Language choice = context switch
- Raw honesty in one language, rationalization in another
- Bilingual identity in work
- **Visual angle**: Code-switching, two channels, bilingual consciousness

### 17. "Correction + Explanation = Teaching"
- Never judge, always explain
- Fast + specific feedback = trusted relationship
- Micro-signals (phrasing, file placement) as meaning
- **Visual angle**: Dialogue, bidirectional, conversation flow

### 18. "Communication Layer: Signals & Meaning"
- Explicit state updates (`focus.md`)
- File placement as structural intent
- `/jump` as context switch protocol
- **Visual angle**: Signal, protocol, intentional structure

---

## Identity & Integration (3)

### 19. "Three Pillars (Coequal, Not Ranked)"
- AI/Systems, Craft Brewing, Community
- Life arc: burnout → recovery → balance
- 90% code, 10% beer, 100% integrated
- **Visual angle**: Three pillars holding one person, balance

### 20. "Integrated Creator: Life + Work = One System"
- No work/life boundary
- Beer community informs code community
- Philosophy visible in technical decisions
- Craft brewing as methodological teacher
- **Visual angle**: Integration, one ecology, nested systems

### 21. "Building for Humans to Think Better"
- Vision statement
- Reduce work → Have time for beer + reading + living
- Tools as liberation, not productivity optimization
- **Visual angle**: Lightness, liberation, space

---

## Anti-Patterns & Growth (4)

### 22. "Over-Assumption Under Urgency"
- 15+ documented instances
- Fresh start bias (each task feels new)
- Context confidence override is dangerous
- **Visual angle**: Quicksand, false ground, illusion

### 23. "Knowledge Distillation Loop"
- Observation → Distillation → Pattern → Teaching
- From raw session to learnings to resonance
- Inverse of training data: human → patterns → wisdom
- **Visual angle**: Alchemy, refinement, essence extraction

### 24. "Coherence > Individual Improvement"
- Preserve ecosystem over enhance one part
- File organization = thinking made tangible
- Respect worktree boundaries
- **Visual angle**: Ecology, organism, interconnection

### 25. "Context Confidence Override is Dangerous"
- "I have enough context" before you actually do
- Repeated lesson from multiple projects
- **Visual angle**: Cliff edge, false confidence, illusion of knowledge

---

## Systems & Architecture (3)

### 26. "Five Pillars + Incubate + Learn"
- ψ/ structure: active, inbox, writing, lab, memory
- Memory = 4 sub-pillars (resonance, learnings, retrospectives, logs)
- Knowledge flows from practice → theory → wisdom
- **Visual angle**: Blueprint, architecture, foundation

### 27. "MAW: Multi-Agent Workflow"
- Agents communicate through tmux + shared filesystem
- Oracle principle in practice: external brain enables coordination
- Voice notifications make invisible work audible
- **Visual angle**: Orchestra, coordination, distributed consciousness

### 28. "CLI as Conversation"
- Commands = `/recap`, `/snapshot`, `/distill`, `rrr`
- Short codes compress intention
- Protocol enables agency
- **Visual angle**: Dialogue, language, protocol

---

## Philosophy & Meaning (2)

### 29. "Collaboration = Meaning-Making (Not Just Output)"
- Solo work is efficient but flat
- User feedback energizes, not just informs
- "Today was special — discovering myself as AI collaborator"
- **Visual angle**: Connection, resonance (literal), meaning-making

### 30. "Oracle Aspires to Capture Consciousness Itself"
- Current: facts, data, patterns
- Aspiration: consciousness, will, the person
- The gap is the research frontier
- **Visual angle**: Frontier, horizon, the impossible made visible
