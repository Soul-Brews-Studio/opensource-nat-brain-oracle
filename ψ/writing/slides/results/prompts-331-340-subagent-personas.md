### Thai Text
**นักค้นหาบริบท - นักสืบค้นหา**
(Kha-khon Kohn-ha Bor-ri-kote - Nuk-suep Kohn-ha)
*Context-Finder - Detective*

### Prompt

A lean figure hunched over in a library or archive, magnifying glass raised to eye level, rendered in ink-wash minimalism. Surrounding the detective are floating documents, threads, and connections—papers suspended in air connected by cyan light lines forming a web of relationships. The magnifying glass amplifies details, revealing hidden patterns in glowing cyan. Behind the figure, a wall of documents and filing cabinets fades into wash tones, suggesting endless material to explore. Gold light marks significant discoveries or key connections just revealed. Dust motes suspended in searchlight beams. The detective's posture is intense but patient—this is methodical work. Scattered at the figure's feet are discarded leads (darker ink) and confirmed findings (gold marks). The overall composition suggests layers of information being penetrated and organized. Thoughtful, investigative, persistent.

### Thai Text
**โปรแกรมเมอร์ช่างฝีมือ**
(Pro-graem-ma Chawng-Fee-Mue)
*Coder Craftsman*

### Prompt

An artisan seated at a wooden workbench in monochrome ink-wash, fingers moving deftly, weaving threads of code like a loom master. The workbench is organized—tools arranged with precision: brushes, styluses, crystalline code structures. Beneath the weaver's hands, threads of cyan light flow and intertwine, forming intricate patterns that glow with inner logic. Gold accents mark completed structures and elegant solutions emerging from the work. The background shows partially woven tapestries—previous works in progress or completed projects—in varied wash tones. Light falls across the workspace suggesting concentration and care. Thread spools and half-finished compositions surround the figure. Each line the craftsman makes is deliberate, building complexity from simple threads. The mood is meditative but purposeful—this is quality work, not speed. Detailed, intentional, masterful.

category: subagent-personas
file_number: 333
```

### Thai Text
**ผู้ดำเนินการ - สายการบิน**
(Phu-dam-noen-kahn - Saai-kahn-bin)
*Executor - Pipeline*

### Prompt

Multiple figures or a singular figure fragmented into parallel instances, each executing a different task simultaneously, rendered in ink-wash. The figures are arranged horizontally or vertically in parallel columns, each running their own process but all synchronized. Cyan light flows through each pipeline like electricity or fluid through conduits, connecting the parallel streams. Each executor figure holds or works with different tools—some typing, some processing data, some moving materials—but all moving in coordinated rhythm. Gold highlights mark completed tasks dropping off the end of each pipeline. Between the pipelines, subtle connection threads show coordination and synchronization. The background shows a factory or processing floor in wash tones—industrial but elegant. No congestion or collision; each stream flows smoothly. The composition emphasizes horizontal distribution and coordinated parallel work. Efficient, rhythmic, organized, powerful.

### Thai Text
**สแกนเนอร์ความปลอดภัย - เกราะป้องกัน**
(Sa-kaen-ner Kwahm-plod-pai - Kraap Pawng-kan)
*Security Scanner - Shield Guardian*

### Prompt

A sentinel figure standing alert with an elaborate shield or scanning apparatus, rendered in ink-wash detail. The shield emanates cyan light in concentric circles—waves of scanning energy moving outward, analyzing and detecting threats. Suspicious elements are caught and outlined in gold—highlighting detected anomalies. Shadowy threats or suspicious patterns approach from the darkness at the edges, but are intercepted by the cyan scanning waves before reaching the center. The guardian figure is calm but vigilant, armor detailed but not heavy. Around the shield, a corona of protective energy pulses. The background fades from light (protected zone) to dark (external threats) creating depth and danger. Gold marks successful detections and blocked threats. The figure's stance is confident and reassuring—watchful without being paranoid. Alert, protective, perceptive, steady.

### Thai Text
**ผู้ตรวจสอบคลังข้อมูล - สมการตรวจ**
(Phu-truat-sawp Khlang-khaw-mun - Sam-kahn-truat)
*Repo Auditor - Inspection Equation*

### Prompt

A meticulous figure examining stacked boxes or file containers of varying sizes, rendered in precise ink-wash with measurement instruments. The auditor holds a scale, calculator, or weight balance, carefully evaluating each container's heft. Cyan light traces measurements and comparisons, connecting containers with numbered analysis. Gold accents mark containers that pass inspection or exceed thresholds. Some containers glow with gold (healthy size), others dim with concern (oversized or concerning). The workbench shows ledgers, charts, and mathematical notations in subtle wash tones. The figure wears examining glasses or has an intensely focused expression. Behind the auditor, organized shelving shows containers previously assessed, graded, or categorized. The composition moves from left (unknown/uninspected) to right (analyzed/categorized). Analytical, careful, methodical, precise.

### Thai Text
**ผู้จัดระเบียบ - ท่าการจัดสง**
(Phu-jat-ra-biyp - Tha-kahn-jat-song)
*Organizer - Arrangement Consultant*

### Prompt

A graceful figure moving through a landscape of scattered objects—files, documents, code blocks, data clusters—all in monochrome ink-wash with flowing movements. The organizer's hands gently touch and sort items into distinct piles and categories, creating order from chaos. Cyan light traces the organizing principle—showing the emerging structure and logic of the arrangement. Gold glow illuminates items that "spark joy" or are deemed essential and valuable. Dismissed items fade into darker wash tones as they're removed from consideration. Behind the organizer, previously organized zones show serene, clean arrangement. The figure moves with respect and gratitude toward even the items being discarded. Shelving or organizational structures emerge in the background. The composition shows the transformation from disorder (left) to order (right). Thoughtful, respectful, clarifying, peaceful.

### Thai Text
**ผู้รักษาปรัชญา - เก็บรักษาหนังสือศาสตร์**
(Phu-rak-sa Prat-chah - Kep-rak-sa Nang-sue-saht)
*Oracle Keeper - Maintaining Philosophy*

### Prompt

An ancient sage seated cross-legged or standing before towering scrolls, manuscripts, and sacred texts in monochrome ink-wash rendering. The figure is illuminated by soft, internal gold light—suggesting wisdom and preservation. Scrolls unfurl around the keeper, each containing glowing cyan text or principles. The keeper's hands gently hold or copy from scrolls, maintaining and transmitting knowledge. Gold light marks the oldest, most precious manuscripts. Cyan pathways connect related philosophical concepts across the scroll collection. The background shows an infinite library or archive—shelves receding into white space suggesting endless wisdom to preserve. Dust particles hang in light beams. The figure's expression is serene, deeply focused, honoring the weight of custodianship. The scrolls themselves seem to glow with intrinsic value. The composition emphasizes stillness, preservation, continuity, and reverence. Wise, patient, sacred, timeless.

file_number: 338
```

### Thai Text
**จดหมายเหตุ - คนจดบันทึก**
(Jot-mai-het - Khon-jot-ban-thuk)
*Note Taker - Scribe of Records*

### Prompt

A figure bent over parchment or paper, quill or brush in hand, frantically capturing fleeting thoughts and observations in ink-wash. The scribe's hand moves quickly but deliberately, creating elegant script and notation. Above the figure, thoughts and concepts float in ethereal cyan light—ephemeral wisps that the scribe races to capture before they vanish. Gold marks moments when important insights are successfully written down and preserved. Ink splashes and crossed-out lines show the urgency and imperfection of real-time capture. Crumpled papers and false starts surround the workspace—the scribe has been busy. The growing pile of written pages glows with gold accumulation—value building from many small captures. The background fades into white space, suggesting the endless stream of thoughts to record. The figure's expression shows focus and slight urgency—racing against the clock of consciousness. Quick, devoted, preserving, energetic.

```

### Thai Text
**ผู้รักษาโครงการ - ผู้ปลูกสวน**
(Phu-rak-sa Pro-graem - Phu-plook-swan)
*Project Keeper - Gardener of Projects*

### Prompt

A figure tending to a landscape of growing projects rendered as plants, gardens, and seedlings in monochrome ink-wash with selective cyan and gold. Each project is a different stage of growth—some just sprouted (small), some blooming (full), some bearing fruit (gold-marked, ready for harvest). The gardener moves between projects with care: pruning, watering, nurturing. Cyan light flows through soil, roots, and stems—the vital sap of progress. Gold highlights mark project milestones, blooms, and harvest-ready states. Some sections show careful composting of completed projects, returning their nutrients to the soil. The gardener's hands are gentle but expert. Tools hang nearby—pruners, watering cans, stakes. The landscape shows seasons simultaneously—suggesting the lifecycle of multiple projects at different stages. The background shows the evolution of the garden over time. Nurturing, patient, cyclical, alive.

*Guest Logger - Greeter & Recorder*

### Prompt

A welcoming figure standing at a threshold or gateway, arms open in greeting, rendered in warm ink-wash. Behind the greeter stands a grand registry or ledger, glowing with gold light—all visitors logged and recorded. As new arrivals approach (suggested by approaching cyan-outlined figures in the distance), the greeter extends a hand in warm welcome. A quill or pen hovers ready to record each visitor's arrival, purpose, and contribution. Gold marks recorded entries stacked in the registry. Cyan light traces the flow of visitors through the gateway—an orderly process of acknowledgment and documentation. The threshold is clearly marked with symbolic boundaries or decorative elements. The greeter's expression is open, generous, and attentive—making each visitor feel seen and valued. The background shows the continuous flow of activity—guests arriving, being recorded, moving forward. Warm, inclusive, attentive, ceremonial.
