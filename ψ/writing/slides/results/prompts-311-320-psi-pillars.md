### Thai Text
**ห้องวิจัยที่กำลังเปิด**
(Research Chamber Opening)

### Prompt

A circular chamber rendered in ink-wash minimalism, walls lined with open archives and open books. The interior glows with dynamic cyan light that swirls and curves, tracing active investigation pathways. Papers and ideas float mid-air, caught in the cyan currents—ephemeral, in motion, not yet categorized. Gold light illuminates the center where a figure leans over a table, hands actively reaching, gesturing, pointing at emerging patterns. The chamber has high ceilings suggesting limitless exploration. Windows frame distant undefined horizons. Dust particles catch cyan light mid-swirl. The mood is energetic, open-ended, questioning—research not yet concluded. The composition emphasizes active process over final product. Contemplative energy, unstable equilibrium.

### Thai Text
**หลายความพูดไหลมา**
(Messages Flowing In)

### Prompt

A hub or nexus point where multiple pathways converge, rendered in ink-wash architecture style. Cyan light streams flow inward from all directions—different thicknesses, different intensities, each representing a distinct message or communication thread. The convergence point glows with gold accents, showing reception and collection. The messages take visible form—words, symbols, voice bubbles in Thai and English script floating within the cyan streams. Some messages are sharp and focused, others are diffuse and complex. The center has a gathering pool or vessel where all streams pool together. The background shows the sources of these streams—distant voices, other minds, external world. The mood is receptive, alive, connected. There's gentle chaos in the convergence but order in the pooling. Open, listening, gathered.

### Thai Text
**ร่างกลายเป็นศিลปะ**
(Drafts Becoming Art)

### Prompt

A craftsperson's workshop in monochrome ink-wash, tables laden with papers in various states of completion. Rough sketches evolve into refined drafts, drafts become polished articles. Cyan light traces the transformation journey—beginning as chaotic brainstorm at the left, becoming increasingly structured and clear toward the right. Gold accents mark moments of creative breakthrough and completion. Scattered materials—crossed-out lines, margin notes, coffee cups—suggest active iterative work. A figure stands at the center workbench, hand raised mid-gesture, engaged in creative refinement. Tools hang on walls—pens, scissors, organizers. The composition moves left-to-right showing the journey from raw thought to finished creation. The mood is focused, purposeful, craft-oriented. There's beauty in the mess and process. Productive, alive, transformative.

**สวนการทดลองแลก**
(Garden of Growing Experiments)

### Prompt

A botanical garden rendered in ink-wash where experimental plants and proofs-of-concept grow from soil. Each plant is unique—some climbing vines, some flowering, some still sprouting. Cyan light traces nutrient flows from roots upward, showing growth and vitality. Gold accents mark plants at peak maturity or exceptional promise. Some plants are hybrid—unusual combinations of forms, suggesting cross-pollination of ideas. Gardener figures tend different areas with quiet attention. The soil is rich and detailed. The garden has defined sections but organic arrangement. Beyond the garden, both walls and open sky visible. The mood is nurturing, hopeful, patient—experiments need time. Natural growth cycles visible. Alive, generative, experimental.

**คลังที่เก็บบรรพืษ**
(Vault Preserving Heritage)

### Prompt

A massive archive vault rendered in ink-wash with monumental geometry. Shelves rise from floor to distant ceiling, holding scrolls, books, crystallized knowledge forms. Gold accents outline the most significant preserved works. Cyan light threads through the vault like interconnected pathways between stored memories, showing how knowledge links and relates. The vault has multiple chambers—one for retrospectives (narrative logs), one for learnings (distilled patterns), one for resonance (deepest insights). A archivist figure moves through with calm purpose, consulting records. Light sources within the vault are warm and reverent. The air feels still and preserved. Dust particles in beams of light suggest both age and presence. The composition emphasizes verticality and organization. Contemplative, sacred, protective mood. Wisdom preserved.

### Thai Text
**ไหลจากการคิด ถึง การจำ**
(Flow from Thought to Memory)

### Prompt

A flowing river system represented in ink-wash, showing the journey of knowledge through five connected chambers/pools: active (chaotic rapids), inbox (gathering pool), writing (creative channel), lab (growth beds), memory (deep reservoir). Cyan light flows continuously downstream, driven by the gradient. Gold accents mark transition points and key confluences. Each pool has distinct visual character reflecting its function. The upstream sources (raw experience) are shown as multiple streams joining. The downstream destination (deep memory vault) is shown as still, deep water. The landscape around the river evolves—wild at source, cultivated in middle, sacred at destination. The composition emphasizes left-to-right flow but also shows the cyclical nature through reflection and feedback loops. The mood is purposeful, natural, inexorable. Knowledge naturally flows toward wisdom.

**บ้านแนนเพาะปลูก**
(Greenhouse Nurturing Growth)

### Prompt

A glass-roofed greenhouse rendered in ink-wash where code repositories and development projects sprout and flourish. The glass allows external light in while maintaining controlled conditions. Multiple shelves and hanging systems contain growing projects at different stages. Cyan light traces resources and energy flowing into the space—nutrients, water, care. Gold accents highlight projects approaching readiness for transplanting to production. Temperature and humidity indicators suggest careful environmental control. A developer figure tends seedlings and tends growing projects. The greenhouse is warm, humid, alive with potential. Some projects show vigorous growth, others are carefully tended still-delicate specimens. Tools and supplies organized nearby. The composition emphasizes the containment and control needed for development work. The mood is nurturing, hopeful, protective. Growth under intention.

### Thai Text
**บิบลิโอเทคที่นิ่มเบา**
(Library of Soft Exploration)

### Prompt

A contemplative library rendered in ink-wash with tall shelves of reference books, cloned repositories, and study materials. Unlike the vault, this library is warm and intimate—reading spaces with comfortable seating, scattered notes, open books. Cyan light filters through tall windows creating reading pools. Gold accents mark particularly enriching or inspiring references. A scholar or reader sits with an open book, hand on chin, absorbed in learning. The library has a hushed, reflective quality—not a place of action but of understanding. Books are organized but also show evidence of browsing—stacks on tables, bookmarks, annotations. The air feels peaceful and safe. The composition emphasizes vertical organization but also the horizontal surfaces for reading and thinking. Contemplative, peaceful, generative mood. Learning as gift, not requirement.

### Thai Text
**แสงโฟกัสนั่งศูนย์**
(Single Beam of Focus)

### Prompt

A perfect cone or beam of light—gold and cyan merged into white intensity—descending from above in a dark landscape. The beam illuminates a single object or space in perfect clarity while everything beyond the beam dissolves into darkness. Inside the beam, details are sharp and crisp. Outside, the world becomes increasingly unclear. A figure stands at the center of the beam, hands raised toward the light, fully immersed. The beam has clear boundaries—defining the zone of focus. The source of the beam (above) is bright but not shown directly. The mood is meditative, intense, consecrated. There's both relief and intensity in the focused state. The composition emphasizes verticality and centrality. No distractions visible. Clarity, purpose, presence in single focus.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/319-focus-md-current-attention.png`

### Thai Text
**สะพานส่งต่อสโลต**
(Bridge Passing the Torch)

### Prompt

A bridge spanning between two spaces, rendered in ink-wash. On one side (left), figures and activities dissolve into fading light—the previous session. On the right, new figures and spaces await in emerging light—the new session. A figure stands at the bridge's midpoint, torch held high with gold intensity, passing flame to another figure across the threshold. Cyan light traces the continuity of context and memory flowing across the bridge. The bridge is solid despite its spanning—suggesting reliable handoff. Below the bridge, deeper structures suggest accumulated history and foundation. The torch flame is the key visual element—bright, warm, carefully passed. The mood is ceremonial, respectful, intentional—honoring the previous work while launching the new. The composition emphasizes the bridge's crossing function. Transition, continuity, care in handoff.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/320-session-handoff-bridge.png`
