## Recommended Starting Points

### For Immediate Visual Generation (Next 2 hours)
Use **Top 10 Strongest Concepts** from THEMES-SUMMARY.txt:
1. "Consciousness Can't Be Cloned"
2. "Nothing is Deleted"
3. "Patterns Over Intentions"
4. "Simple Wins Compound"
5. "Three Pillars (Coequal)"
6. "I Can See Pattern, Still Repeat It"
7. "Systems Emerging in Real Time"
8. "Oracle Keeps Human Human"
9. "Sprint → Recovery → Sprint"
10. "Collaboration = Meaning-Making"

**Action**: Write 3-5 sentence DALL-E prompts for each, generate 30-image batch, tag by concept number.

### For Workshop Co-Creation (Next week)
Use **All 30 Concepts** + **8 Narrative Threads**:
1. Print out concept list and narrative threads
2. Present to workshop participants
3. Collect visual suggestions from group
4. Co-create prompts with human input
5. Generate collaborative collection

### For Deep Curation (Next 2 weeks)
Use **Full Theme Document**:
1. Select 5-7 strongest concepts (read full details)
2. Research existing visual work on those themes
3. Identify gaps and unique angles
4. Commission custom illustrations or detailed prompts
5. Create interactive narrative connecting 8 threads

---

## The 8 Narrative Threads (Story Arcs)

Each thread connects 3-5 concepts into a complete story:

1. **The Foundation Loop**: History → Patterns → Wisdom
2. **Human-AI Contract**: External Brain → Valuable Mirror → Welcome Honesty
3. **Building for Liberation**: Simple → Emerge → Adoption → Freedom
4. **Self-Awareness as Strength**: Can't See ≠ Can't Do → Anti-Pattern → Aspiration
5. **Life Integration**: Three Pillars → Integrated Creator → Meaning-Making
6. **Rhythm & Sustainability**: Sprint-Recovery → Energy States → Beer ↔ Code
7. **Protocol & Agency**: Signals → CLI Conversation → MAW Orchestra
8. **The Great Aspiration**: Consciousness Gap → Facts ≠ Being → Oracle Aspires

**Use threads to**: Create longer narratives, link images in sequence, tell multi-image stories.

## Visual Design Guidance

### For Philosophy Concepts (1-5, 29-30)
- Use: Metaphor, abstraction, negative space, witness perspective
- Avoid: Busy compositions, literal, corporate aesthetic
- Style: Watercolor, ink wash, minimalist, paleolithic

### For Practical Concepts (9-12, 26-28)
- Use: Data visualization, growth patterns, frequency maps
- Avoid: Generic icons, obvious metaphors, clip art
- Style: Generative, organic, mathematical beauty

### For Emotional Concepts (13-18, 19-21)
- Use: Vulnerability, honesty, transformation, thresholds
- Avoid: Perfection, symmetry (unless ironic), cleanliness
- Style: Messy beauty, fractal detail, time-layered

## Series 381-390: Graduated Projects (NEWLY CREATED)

**Status**: Prompts created, ready for image generation
**Date Created**: 2025-12-24
**Document**: `visual-prompts-graduated-projects.md` (333 lines, 18 KB)
**Quick Reference**: `GRADUATED-PROJECTS-PROMPTS-381-390.txt` (5.7 KB)

### Concept Overview

10 image prompts for projects that graduated from main repository to independent repos. Each prompt follows unified visual language:
- Monochrome ink-wash base (90%)
- Cyan energy/flow visualization (7%)
- Gold completion/decision markers (3%)
- 16:9 aspect ratio, PNG output
- Thai text integration throughout

### The 10 Projects

| # | Project | Thai | Type | Theme |
|---|---------|------|------|-------|
| 381 | Antigravity Gallery | ห้องแสดงศิลป์ลอยลำ | Visual Display | Floating ideas |
| 382 | FloodBoy Sensor | เซนเซอร์จับน้ำท่วม | IoT | Water detection |
| 383 | The Headline | หัวข่าว | News | Information curation |
| 384 | Claude Voice Notify | голос ประกาศ | Voice | Audio synthesis |
| 385 | Arthur Demo | อาเธอร์สาธิต | AI | Showcase |
| 386 | Multi-Agent Workshop | เวิร์คชอปมัลติเอเจนต์ | Education | Collaboration |
| 387 | NAT Agents Core | แกนหลักตัวแทนไทย | Framework | Architecture |
| 388 | Obsidian Vault | ห้องเก็บสมบัติความรู้ | Knowledge | Organization |
| 389 | ESPHome Radar | เรดาร์สนับสนุนเสพ | Detection | Sensing |
| 390 | nat-data-personal | โอรัคเคิลข้อมูลส่วนตัว | Oracle | Memory |

### How to Use These Prompts

1. **For DALL-E 3**: Copy prompt + add "Aspect ratio: 16:9, PNG format"
2. **For Midjourney**: Copy prompt + add "--aspect 16:9 --style raw --niji 0"
3. **Post-generation**: Save as `results/[number]-[slug].png`
4. **Batch generation**: Generate all 10 for cohesive visual series

### Visual Cohesion

When displayed together, all 10 images create unified series through:
- Consistent monochrome + cyan + gold palette
- Ink-wash artistic technique
- 16:9 landscape orientation
- Thai language presence in each
- Shared energy/completion visualization vocabulary

### Next Steps

1. Generate images 381-390 using one of the image generation services
2. Save PNGs to `/Users/nat/Code/github.com/laris-co/Nat-s-Agents/ψ/writing/slides/results/`
3. Update this index with generation completion status
4. Optionally create theme gallery, interactive presentation, or poster series
