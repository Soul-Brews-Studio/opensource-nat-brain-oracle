file_number: 341
```

### Thai Text
**ค้นหาโครงการที่ว่างเว้น**
(Finding Lost Projects)

### Prompt

An archaeological excavation site depicted in ink-wash style. Layers of earth reveal buried artifacts—old commit hashes, forgotten branch names, and dormant project folders emerging from darkness. Cyan light traces through the sediment like root systems, illuminating pathways between past and present. A single figure with a lantern descends into layers, their light revealing connections and timelines. Gold outlines mark significant discoveries—the moments when lost history becomes visible again. Dust particles suspended in air catch cyan light. The composition moves downward, suggesting deep excavation through time. Minimal, poetic, archaeological reverence.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/341-trace-finding-lost-projects.png`

file_number: 342
```

### Thai Text
**จับภาพสิ่งที่จำเป็น**
(Quick Knowledge Capture)

### Prompt

A camera's aperture freezing a moment mid-motion. Ink-wash background with flowing water or mist being crystallized in place. Cyan light rays converge through the lens, sharp and precise, capturing ephemeral thoughts and patterns. The moment being frozen is complex—overlapping threads, ideas, connections—but the camera distills it into clarity. Gold light marks the edges of the captured frame, suggesting preservation and value. Around the frame's edges, time continues flowing in darker wash tones, but inside the frame everything is held in crystalline stillness. Minimalist, contemplative, decisive.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/342-snapshot-quick-capture.png`

### Thai Text
**สกัดสารที่บริสุทธิ์**
(Pattern Extraction)

### Prompt

An alchemist's workspace in monochrome ink-wash. Multiple complex vessels and alembics contain swirling mixtures—raw data, observations, noise—flowing through interconnected tubes. Cyan energy traces the refinement process, moving through filters and distillation chambers. At each stage, impurities fall away (darker ink) while essential patterns concentrate. The final vessel glows with gold light, containing distilled essence—pure pattern, concentrated truth. Smoke and vapor rise from heated chambers. Equipment is precise but organic, suggesting both science and intuition. The composition shows transformation across horizontal space—input to output.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/343-distill-pattern-extraction.png`

```

### Thai Text
**แผนที่ของดินแดนใหม่**
(Map of Fresh Terrain)

### Prompt

A cartographer's map emerging from morning mist, rendered in ink-wash with careful detail lines. The map shows recent terrain traversed—mountains climbed (gold peaks), valleys explored (deeper wash), connections discovered (cyan pathways). Contour lines and elevation markers in subtle gray. A figure stands at the center of the map, orienting themselves, with a compass rose nearby. Gold thread traces the key decision points and milestones. The edges of the map fade into white, suggesting unmapped territory ahead. The map is being unrolled or revealed, not yet fully laid out. Minimal text labels in English and Thai. Contemplative, grounding, preparatory mood.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/344-recap-fresh-start.png`

### Thai Text
**กระโดดระหว่างโลก**
(Jumping Between Contexts)

### Prompt

Parkour silhouettes leaping between floating platforms, each representing a different context or topic. Ink-wash rendering with geometric platform shapes. Cyan light trails behind the figure as they move mid-jump, showing trajectory and momentum. Gold outlines mark landing zones. Platforms are at varying heights and distances, suggesting the cognitive leap required. Below the platforms, a darker void or ocean in wash tones. The figure is captured mid-motion, dynamic and confident. Stacked visually but spatially separated—suggesting navigation through layers. Multiple possible paths visible. High energy, kinetic, acrobatic.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/345-jump-topic-navigation.png`

file_number: 346
```

### Thai Text
**ความเร็วของการปฏิบัติ**
(Speed of Execution)

### Prompt

A sprinter captured mid-stride in minimalist ink-wash, pushing hard forward. Cyan energy trails and momentum lines stream behind the figure in parallel curves, suggesting velocity and power. Gold light at the figure's feet marks each ground contact point. The background is simplified wash tones suggesting motion blur or focused tunnel vision. Wind or energy distortion around the body. The composition is diagonal or forward-leaning, conveying urgency and momentum. Multiple afterimage suggestions or speed lines. The figure's expression determined, muscles tensed. The scene captures the exact moment of maximum effort. Fast, intense, unstoppable.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/346-gogogo-rapid-execution.png`

### Thai Text
**คิวของการรอคอย**
(Queue of Waiting)

### Prompt

Figures standing in a patient line, rendered in ink-wash minimalism. Each figure is distinct but similar, wearing slightly different garments or postures suggesting varied tasks. Cyan light connects them in sequence, showing order and flow. Gold markers highlight the front of the queue (what's next) and time progression. The line curves gently into space, suggesting continuation beyond the frame. Above each figure, subtle priority indicators or task labels in Thai script. The background is calm, cool wash tones suggesting organized waiting. A figure at the front is already moving—showing the queue's function. Peaceful but purposeful, organized, patient.

### Thai Text
**นกปล่อยจากรัง**
(Bird Leaving the Nest)

### Prompt

A young bird launching from its nest into open sky, painted in ink-wash. The nest is rendered in dark, woven detail below. The bird is captured mid-takeoff, wings spread wide, with cyan light streaming beneath the wings showing lift and buoyancy. Gold outlines trace the bird's form and the path of flight. The sky above is open and white, full of possibility. Beneath the nest, clouds or landscape suggest the drop, the risk. The bird's eye is bright and determined. Wind currents suggested through curved air lines. The composition emphasizes upward motion and liberation. The nest remains below—still there, still safe, but the bird has moved beyond it. Hopeful, brave, transformative.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/348-spinoff-project-graduation.png`

### Thai Text
**วงกลมแบ่งปัญหา**
(Circle Sharing Status)

### Prompt

Multiple figures standing in a circle, viewed from above or at slight angle, rendered in minimalist ink-wash. Each figure is distinct—different heights, postures, orientations. Cyan light connects them in circular flow, suggesting shared connection and reciprocal communication. Gold accents mark each person as equal contributors. In the center of the circle, subtle symbols or glyphs suggesting the topics being discussed. Speech bubbles or thought clouds in Thai and English script float lightly around. The ground beneath is marked with a simple circle—defining the gathering space. The composition is balanced and democratic, no hierarchy. Warm, inclusive, collaborative mood. Daily ritual feeling.

### Thai Text
**ลูกศรแยกออกเป็นสายน้ำ**
(Arrows Splitting into Streams)

### Prompt

A single powerful arrow or beam splitting into multiple parallel streams, rendered in ink-wash with cyan and gold accents. The origin point is bold and focused (gold), the splitting point is dynamic, and the resulting streams are cyan—each flowing in parallel but independent directions. Each stream has its own intensity and character, suggesting different agents with different tasks. The background shows minimal wash tones allowing the streams to be the focal point. Where streams interact or are near each other, there's subtle interference patterns. The composition moves left-to-right or top-to-bottom showing the branching and distribution of effort. No collision or conflict between streams—they move in harmony despite independence. Coordinated, energetic, distributed.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/350-parallel-multi-agent.png`
