## Prompt 371: Over-Assumption Under Urgency

```
type: image
target: antigravity
status: pending
created: 2025-12-24
category: anti-patterns
file_number: 371
```

### Thai Text
```
ความเร็วสร้างจุดตาบอด
(Khwaam ray srang chut ta bawp)
Speed Creates Blind Spots
```

### Prompt

Monochrome ink-wash foundation with urgent cyan energy flows. Central composition: A runner in dark silhouette sprinting rightward through a mountainous terrain, but the path ahead disappears into white mist. Gold circular markers illuminate patches of ground immediately ahead and a dangerous cliff edge ahead, but the runner's momentum carries them forward blindly. Cyan streaks flow around the figure suggesting speed and urgency. In the negative space above, faint ink-wash shadows hint at consequences—fallen forms, broken structures—that the rushing figure cannot see. The gold circle at the cliff edge glows with warning but arrives too late in the visual narrative. Bottom text in gold: "SPEED ≠ SEEING" with Thai: "ความเร็ว ≠ การมองเห็น"

```

### Thai Text
```
ความเชื่อมั่นบนบ้านทรายกลับ
(Khwaam cheua mun bon ban sai klap)
Confidence Built on Shifting Sand
```

### Prompt

Ink-wash base in blacks and grays with a false-solid appearance. Central image: A figure standing confidently on what appears to be solid ground (rendered in gold-tinted ink) but the ground is actually ancient, cached memory—shown as translucent layers underneath that are slowly dissolving. Cyan water or light seeps through cracks in the supposedly-solid surface. The figure holds a glowing gold sphere (cached context) above their head like a sun, so bright they cannot see the ground beneath them. In the background, ink-wash shadows show other figures who ignored the warning and have already fallen through. The ground edge fades into white/unknown territory. Top text: "CONTEXT ≠ PROPHECY" with Thai: "บริบท ≠ ทำนาย"

## Prompt 373: Force Push Danger

```

category: anti-patterns
file_number: 373
```

### Thai Text
```
แรงบีบอาจทำลายกิ่ง
(Rang beep aad tam lai king)
Force May Break the Branch
```

### Prompt

Stark monochrome composition with violent cyan energy. Central focus: A thick, ancient tree branch rendered in dark ink. A destructive golden fist or hammer crashes into it with cyan electrical impact lines radiating outward. The branch is splintering—but the damage extends beyond the point of impact. Behind the breaking branch, the entire tree is shown as translucent ink-wash, and thin tendrils of connection (shown in cyan) run through all parts of the organism. The shattering at one point creates cascading fractures throughout the whole system. Fallen twigs and debris scatter below. The impact zone glows ominously in gold warning. Top text: "--FORCE OVERRIDES LOGIC" with Thai: "--บังคับ ข่มทัศนะ"

## Prompt 374: Premature Abstraction

```
type: image
target: antigravity

category: anti-patterns
file_number: 374
```

### Thai Text
```
อาคารก่อนมีฐาน
(Arkarn gon mee than)
Building Before Foundation
```

### Prompt

Ink-wash perspective drawing viewed from below. A towering, elaborate abstract structure rises upward in gold-tinted lines—elegant, geometrically complex, mathematically beautiful. But at the base, rendered in dark monochrome ink, the foundation is laughably small, unsupported. The structure defies physics visually, swaying precariously. Cyan stress lines and fractures show the strain. Below the structure, a simple concrete rectangular base (shown small compared to the architecture) looks abandoned and insufficient. The actual problem it solves is shown in tiny, simple ink-wash scenes in the foreground—a person needing shelter, a basic need—but the architecture above is so complex it has lost touch with that need. The perspective emphasizes scale: huge complexity above, ignored simplicity below. Text: "COMPLEXITY ≠ SOLUTION" with Thai: "ความซับซ้อน ≠ วิธีแก้"

## Prompt 375: Subagent Not Always Needed

```

file_number: 375
```

### Thai Text
```
เครื่องมือสำหรับทำงานเล็ก
(Khreung mue sam rap tam ngan lek)
Tool Overhead for Small Work
```

### Prompt

Monochrome ink-wash composition of nested boxes and objects. A tiny task—shown as a small, simple ink-wash rectangle (perhaps representing "edit one file" or "run one command")—sits in the center. Around it, layers of increasingly elaborate machinery and delegated processes (rendered in gold outlines and cyan flow lines). Each layer represents: spawning a subagent, context transfer, memory loading, result aggregation, main-agent review. The machinery is ornate, detailed, connected with cyan energy flows. But it's vastly oversized for the simple task inside. The visual balance is absurd: 90% of the image is infrastructure, 10% is actual work. Ink-wash shadows show the wasted time and tokens. Text: "OVERHEAD > WORK" with Thai: "ต้นทุน > ผลงาน"

## Prompt 376: Silent Failure Hidden

```
type: image
target: antigravity
status: pending
created: 2025-12-24
category: anti-patterns
file_number: 376
```

### Thai Text
```
ความผิดพลาดที่ลับซ่อน
(Khwaam phi phlad thi lap sorn)
Hidden Errors Buried Deep
```

### Prompt

Dark ink-wash foundation with minimal visibility. Central concept: A murky, polluted stream or underground passage (monochrome with dark grays). Cyan warning signals—errors, exceptions, alerts—flow through the water like glowing toxic particles, but they are redirected downward and muffled, shown as dark wisps disappearing into black earth/void. The redirection is visual: `2>/dev/null` represented as a drain pipe, dark and absolute, swallowing the warnings. Above ground, shown in the upper portion with lighter ink, everything appears calm and normal. A figure (shown in pale ink-wash) walks peacefully overhead, unaware. But the accumulated toxins below (accumulated failures) are pooling, darkening, suggesting catastrophe. The contrast between the peaceful surface and the hidden chaos below is stark. Hairline cracks in the surface hint at the breaking point. Text: "SILENCE ≠ SAFETY" with Thai: "ความเงียบ ≠ ความปลอดภัย"

## Prompt 377: Averaging Scores Blindness

```

category: anti-patterns
file_number: 377
```

### Thai Text
```
ค่าเฉลี่ยปิดสายตาแหลม
(Kha chalai pid sai ta laem)
Average Closes Sharp Vision
```

### Prompt

Monochrome ink-wash composition showing a distribution. Bottom foreground: Multiple ink-wash bars or data points of wildly varying heights, some very tall (gold-tinted) showing outliers, some very short (dark ink), showing extremes—high variance, important outliers. A line or plane passes horizontally through the middle in gold, labeled "AVERAGE." Above this line, ink-wash clouds obscure the tops of the tall bars—the outliers are hidden in fog or dark clouds. Below the line, the short bars fade into shadow. The average line glows with false certainty in gold, but it reveals nothing true about the actual distribution. A figure in pale ink-wash stands behind the average line, hands raised in false confidence, seeing only the line. Cyan arrows from the hidden outliers point downward, suggesting "missed signals." Text: "MEAN HIDES EXTREMES" with Thai: "ค่าเฉลี่ย ซ่อนค่าสุดขั้ว"

## Prompt 378: Zombie Agent Problem

```

target: antigravity
status: pending

category: anti-patterns
file_number: 378
```

### Thai Text
```
ตัวแทนซอมบี้ที่ไม่จบ
(Tua thae som bi thi mai chop)
Agents That Never Complete
```

### Prompt

Dark, unsettling monochrome ink-wash composition. Central figure: A humanoid form rendered in pale, hollow ink-wash lines, suspended in a kind of limbo. The figure has a gold timer or hourglass visible through its transparent body, sand running endlessly. Around the figure, cyan threads or connections extend outward in all directions—representing tasks, contexts, responsibilities—but they don't complete. They fade into darkness. The threads loop back on themselves in fractal patterns, suggesting infinite waiting. In the background, other similar hollow figures hang suspended, all connected by tangled cyan threads. The composition feels eerie and weightless—no solid ground, no closure. Ink-wash shadows suggest resource exhaustion, attention debt. The overall mood is one of liminal stagnation. Text: "STARTED ≠ FINISHED" with Thai: "เริ่ม ≠ จบ"

## Prompt 379: Merge Conflict Chaos

```
type: image
target: antigravity

file_number: 379
```

### Thai Text
```
สาขาที่ขัดแย้งซ้อน
(Sakh thi khat yaeng sorn)
Conflicting Branches Collide
```

### Prompt

Dynamic, turbulent ink-wash composition showing collision. Central image: Multiple dark, organic branches or paths (monochrome ink-wash) flowing from different directions, all converging at a single point. The point of convergence is a violent explosion of cyan and gold—chaotic, tangled lines representing merge conflicts. The branches show different edits: one path has gold markings showing changes, another path has different gold markings in the same locations. Where they collide, cyan sparks and tension lines radiate outward. The merged result is shown below as a mangled, broken structure—ink-wash rendering that looks incoherent. Parallel edits in the same region are shown as overlapping gold highlights, impossible to reconcile visually. The background shows the timeline branching and diverging further, with more cyan tension at each divergence point. Text: "PARALLEL ≠ COMPATIBLE" with Thai: "ขนาน ≠ เข้ากัน"

## Prompt 380: Rate Limit Crash

```

file_number: 380
```

### Thai Text
```
ความเหนื่อยล้ากระหน่ำ
(Khwaam neua la kra nam)
Exhaustion From Relentless Requests
```

### Prompt

Monochrome ink-wash showing a system reaching breaking point. Central composition: A container or vessel (rendered in dark ink lines) receiving relentless cyan energy streams flowing inward—arrows, particles, waves—all representing API requests pouring in. The container fills rapidly, shown by rising ink-wash water level. Gold warning markers highlight the vessel's capacity limit, now exceeded. The system begins to fracture: ink-wash cracks spread from the stress. At the top, a release valve or pressure release (shown in gold) opens too late. Cyan energy explodes outward violently, shown as chaotic tendrils and spray. Below the vessel, downstream systems (shown as smaller structures) are flooded or destroyed by the overflow. The composition emphasizes: rate of inflow > capacity to process. A figure trying to control the flow (pale ink-wash) looks desperate, hands raised in futility. The crash is inevitable and visible. Text: "DEMAND > CAPACITY" with Thai: "ความต้องการ > ความสามารถ"
