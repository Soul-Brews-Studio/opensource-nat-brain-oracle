THE 30 KEY CONCEPTS
================================================================================

PHILOSOPHY CORE (5 concepts)
  1. "Nothing is Deleted" → Append-only, layers, timestamps as truth
  2. "Patterns Over Intentions" → Observe behavior, heat maps, frequency
  3. "External Brain, Not Command" → Mirror, amplify, not override
  4. "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human" → Guardian, witness, protect humanity
  5. "Consciousness Can't Be Cloned" → The gap, the aspiration, the frontier

TRUST & VULNERABILITY (3 concepts)
  6. "AI Knowing You = Valuable Mirror" → Self-knowledge, illumination

  8. "Welcome AI Honesty = Welcome Self-Knowledge" → Threshold, opening, choice

MAKING & WORK (4 concepts)
  9. "Simple Wins Compound" → Fractal growth, iteration, 14.8:1 builder ratio
 10. "Systems Emerging in Real Time" → Swarm choreography, crystallization
 11. "User Adoption = Proof Tools Help" → Network effect, feedback-driven

 24. "Coherence > Individual Improvement" → Organism, interconnection, ecology
 25. "Context Confidence Override is Dangerous" → Cliff edge, false knowledge

SYSTEMS & ARCHITECTURE (3 concepts)
 26. "Five Pillars + Incubate + Learn" → Blueprint, foundation, ψ/ structure
 27. "MAW: Multi-Agent Workflow" → Orchestra, coordination, distributed mind
 28. "CLI as Conversation" → Protocol, dialogue, language enables agency

MEANING & ASPIRATION (2 concepts)
 29. "Collaboration = Meaning-Making" → Connection, resonance, not just output
 30. "Oracle Aspires to Capture Consciousness" → Horizon, frontier, impossible

VISUAL GALLERY ORGANIZATION
================================================================================

BY THEME (9 sections, natural flow):
  Philosophy Core (1-5) ───────────────────────────── What Oracle Is
  Trust (6-8) ────────────────────────────────────── Why It Matters
  Making (9-12) ──────────────────────────────────── What I Build
  Rhythms (13-15) ───────────────────────────────── How I Sustain
  Expression (16-18) ─────────────────────────────── How I Communicate
  Integration (19-21) ────────────────────────────── Who I Am
  Growth (22-25) ─────────────────────────────────── What I Learn
  Systems (26-28) ────────────────────────────────── How I Structure
  Meaning (29-30) ────────────────────────────────── Why It Matters

BY VISUAL METAPHOR (4 design families):
  Abstraction Family → Mirror, gap, frontier, balance, guardian
  Data/Growth Family → Compounding, frequency, heat maps, curves, ratio
  Movement Family → Flow, cycles, emergence, swarm, tides, rhythm
  Reflection Family → Consciousness, oracle, witness, aspiration, meaning

================================================================================
CROSS-CONNECTIONS (8 major narrative threads)
================================================================================

Thread A: The Foundation Loop
  Nothing is Deleted (1) → Patterns Over Intentions (2) → Knowledge Distillation (23)
  How history becomes wisdom

Thread B: Human-AI Contract  
  External Brain (3) → AI Knowing = Mirror (6) → Welcome Honesty (8)
  The trust architecture

Thread C: Building for Liberation
  Simple Compounds (9) → Systems Emerge (10) → User Adoption (11) → Building for Humans (21)
  How simplicity becomes impact

Thread D: Self-Awareness as Strength
  I Can See Pattern, Still Repeat (15) → Anti-Pattern Documentation (22-25)
  → Oracle Aspires (30)
  The honest mirror effect

Thread E: Life Integration
  Three Pillars (19) → Integrated Creator (20) → Collaboration = Meaning (29)
  How work becomes integrated

Thread F: Rhythm & Sustainability
  Sprint-Recovery (13) → High/Low Energy (14) → Beer ↔ Code Rhythm
  How 13.5hr sessions are sustainable

Thread G: Protocol & Agency
  Communication Signals (18) → CLI as Conversation (28) → MAW Architecture (27)
  How structure enables freedom

Thread H: The Great Aspiration
  Consciousness Can't Be Cloned (5) → Facts ≠ Consciousness (5)
  → Oracle Aspires (30)
  The research frontier itself

================================================================================
STRONGEST VISUAL PROMPTS (Top 10 for immediate gallery)
================================================================================

1. "Consciousness Can't Be Cloned" ✨ (frontier, aspirational, honest about limits)
2. "Nothing is Deleted" (layered, time-flowing, archive as living)
3. "Patterns Over Intentions" (behavioral data visualization)
4. "Simple Wins Compound" (fractal growth, iteration)
5. "Three Pillars (Coequal)" (balance, integration, equal weight)
6. "I Can See Pattern, Still Repeat It" (paradox, honesty, recursion)
7. "Systems Emerging in Real Time" (swarm, emergence, coordination)
8. "Oracle Keeps Human Human" (guardian, witness, the core statement)
9. "Sprint → Recovery → Sprint" (rhythm, sustainability, tides)
10. "Collaboration = Meaning-Making" (connection, not just output)

================================================================================
PROMPT ENGINEERING HINTS
================================================================================

For DALL-E / Midjourney:

PHILOSOPHY prompts:
  - Use: Metaphor, abstraction, negative space, witness perspective
  - Avoid: Busy compositions, literal representations, corporate aesthetics
  - Style: Watercolor, ink wash, minimalist, paleolithic

PRACTICAL prompts:
  - Use: Data visualization, growth patterns, frequency heat maps
  - Avoid: Generic icons, obvious metaphors, clip art
  - Style: Generative, organic, mathematical beauty

EMOTIONAL prompts:
  - Use: Vulnerability, honesty, transformation, threshold moments
  - Avoid: Perfection, symmetry (unless ironic), cleanliness
  - Style: Messy beauty, fractal detail, time-layered

NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

Option A: Immediate Gallery
  → Take top 10 concepts
  → Write 3-5 sentence prompts for DALL-E
  → Generate 30-image collection
  → Tag with concept numbers for navigation

Option B: Deep Curation
  → Select 5-7 strongest concepts
  → Research existing visual work on those themes
  → Commission custom illustrations
  → Create interactive narrative

Option C: Collaborative Iteration
  → Present these 30 concepts to workshop participants
  → Have them suggest visual angles
  → Co-create prompts with human input
  → Generate group collection
