## Prompt
Monochrome ink-wash painting of single ancient tree growing upward (roots visible below, crown above). Root system branches show FOUNDATION topics (fundamentals, basics), each root thick with golden nutrient flow. Main trunk ascends, thickening with cyan energy upward. Branches split outward at intervals, each major branch representing topic category (Teaching, Assessment, Design, etc.), sub-branches showing specific lessons. Leaves at ends glow with gold—completion, mastery points. Watercolor wash fills spaces between branches with warmth. Zero gravity lifts entire tree slightly, suggesting growth. Student figures positioned at different heights (climbing, exploring, gathering fruit). Oracle style emphasizes ORGANIC GROWTH and INTERCONNECTION. No strict linear path—multiple routes through tree. Ink shadows provide depth. Living system, not static chart.
