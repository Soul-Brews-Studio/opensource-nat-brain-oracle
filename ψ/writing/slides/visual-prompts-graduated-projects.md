"The Multi-Agent Workshop"

### Prompt
An overhead view (bird's eye perspective) rendered in monochrome ink-wash showing multiple workstations or nodes arranged in organic network formation. Each node is a small circle or point rendered in dark blacks with subtle gray gradients. Cyan connecting lines flow between nodes in curved pathways, showing communication and collaboration patterns. Thick and thin line weights suggest message flow intensity. Gold junction points highlight synchronization moments or completed handoffs between agents. The entire network appears to be in motion - flowing curves suggest active dialogue. Vertical white space dominates the composition while black elements create structure. Center area shows a teaching nexus with radiating pathways. Table surfaces shown as horizontal wash lines. Scattered papers or notes on surfaces rendered as small text fragments in Thai fonts (Prompt, Kanit). A few human figures rendered as simple line drawings positioned throughout, indicating human participants in the workshop. 16:9 landscape format emphasizing distributed network spread horizontally.

"The Thai Agent Foundation"

### Prompt
A structural blueprint rendered in ink-wash showing interconnected geometric forms (circles, squares, hexagons) stacked and arranged vertically like architectural layers or strata. Darkest blacks form the core central structure. Gray wash creates planes and depth between layers. Each layer represents a different system component or abstraction level. Cyan connecting lines show energy flow and information pathways vertically and horizontally through the structure. Gold reinforcement points highlight critical junctions and completed integration points. Small Thai text labels (Sarabun font) identifying layers: foundation, abstraction, interface, orchestration. The entire structure radiates outward from a central core nexus in the bottom center. Right side shows ascending complexity and capability gain. Left side grounds structure in fundamentals. Ethereal quality with soft edges transitioning from pure white outer edges to deep black core. 16:9 landscape with structure occupying center and lower-middle region, allowing breathing room above.

**File Number**: 388

### Title in English
Obsidian Vault - Knowledge Management System

### Thai Text
ห้องเก็บสมบัติความรู้
(Hong Kep Sombat Khomruu)
"The Knowledge Treasury Chamber"

### Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash illustration of nested vaults or chambers, each layer slightly receding into depth. Heavy black obsidian-like borders frame rectangular and circular compartments. Pages or scrolls visible inside chambers, rendered as white rectangles with fine black text (too small to read, suggesting information density). Cyan threads or links interconnecting knowledge nodes between chambers - some links direct, others curved and flowing. Gold markers highlight important connections or decision points where knowledge converges. A magnifying glass or focal point draws a bright gold circle around one central piece of knowledge in the innermost chamber. Surrounding haze created through ink-wash diffusion suggests vast knowledge quantity beyond immediate view. Some pages appear to float or move suggesting dynamic nature. Thai text labels (Noto Sans Thai) marking vault sections and categories. Dry brush texture suggests stone or ancient material quality. 16:9 composition with vaults arranged left to right showing progressive expansion outward.

### Title in English
ESPHome Radar - Presence Detection Hardware

### Thai Text
เรดาร์สนับสนุนเสพ
(Redah Subnansanun Sep)
"The Presence Sensing Radar"

### Prompt
A radar or sonar visualization rendered in monochrome ink-wash showing concentric circular scan lines emanating from a central point (the sensor device). Heavy black lines form the radar grid. Cyan energy pulses outward in rings from center, showing active detection scanning. Target objects appear as simple geometric shapes (circles, squares) within the scan zone, rendered in gray with subtle gradients. Where targets are detected, cyan highlighting intensifies and gold markers appear. The outer circles fade into soft ink-wash suggestion of extended range beyond visible detection. Small hexagonal shape at center represents the ESP device (abstract stylized form). Detection history shown as fading ghost rings - previous scans shown in lighter gray behind active scans. Right edge shows data readout as minimal vertical bars and numbers (Thai numerals in Kanit font). Radial lines create sense of motion and active scanning. 16:9 composition with radar centered slightly left of image center, scan zone extending right.

**File Number**: 390

### Title in English
nat-data-personal - Personal Data Oracle

### Thai Text
โอรัคเคิลข้อมูลส่วนตัว
(Orakul Khomul Suantu)
"The Personal Data Oracle"

### Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash portrait of a central spherical form (oracle) containing layered transparent information fragments - text, dates, memories rendered as white paper fragments visible within dark sphere. The sphere pulses with cyan energy radiating outward in organic wave patterns. Gold threads connect outward from the core to surrounding node points representing different data categories or memory clusters. Around the sphere, arranged in organic constellation pattern, smaller nodes float in space - each representing a data point or life moment. These nodes connected back to core with thin gold filaments showing relationship and linkage. Thai script floats in various orientations around the composition in Prompt font - timestamps, categories, emotional resonance indicators. The overall effect suggests a living memory archive - a place where personal history is preserved, indexed, and constantly conversational. Dry-brush texture on edges suggesting passing of time and accumulation of moments. Ethereal quality despite information density. 16:9 landscape with oracle sphere centered, surrounding constellation spreading outward into soft fading white space.

## Generation Instructions

### For DALL-E 3

Each prompt is designed to be used directly with DALL-E 3. Format as follows:

```
[Prompt text from above]
Aspect ratio: 16:9
Style: Monochrome ink-wash with cyan energy lines and gold completion markers
Output format: PNG
```

### For Midjourney

Add these parameters to each prompt:

```
--aspect 16:9 --style raw --niji 0
```

### Post-Processing

After generation:
1. Verify 16:9 aspect ratio
2. Check color palette matches style guide (mono + cyan + gold only)
3. Verify Thai text is readable (check fonts: Noto Sans Thai, Prompt, Kanit, Sarabun)
4. Save to `/Users/nat/Code/github.com/laris-co/Nat-s-Agents/ψ/writing/slides/results/`
5. Filename format: `[number]-[slug].png`
6. Add file entry to INDEX-visual-prompts.md

## Visual Style Reference

### Color Palette
- **Base**: 90% monochrome (blacks, grays, whites)
- **Accent Energy**: 7% cyan (#00D9FF or similar bright cyan)
- **Completion Markers**: 3% gold (#FFD700 or similar warm gold)
- **Total**: Minimal color for maximum impact

### Ink-Wash Technique
- Dry brush edges for texture
- Soft diffusion transitions between values
- Layered transparency suggesting depth
- Gradient washes for atmospheric effect

### Thai Typography
- **Noto Sans Thai**: Body text, labels
- **Prompt**: Headings, emphasis
- **Kanit**: Technical, data elements
- **Sarabun**: Secondary labels, small text

All text should be:
- Readable at thumbnail size
- Positioned for balance (not overcrowded)
- Used sparingly (let imagery speak)
