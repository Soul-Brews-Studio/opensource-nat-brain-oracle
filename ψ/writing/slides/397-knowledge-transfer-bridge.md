# Knowledge Transfer Bridge

## Thai Text
สะพานการถ่ายโอนความรู้ - ศาสตร์สู่นักเรียน
(Sa parn kar thai ohn kwamru - Sastriyastu nak rian)

## Prompt
Monochrome ink-wash landscape with deep chasm. Left cliff: wise teacher figure surrounded by golden books, scrolls, accumulated knowledge (shown as glowing knowledge orbs). Right cliff: eager students reaching upward. Golden bridge spans the chasm, with cyan light flowing from teacher across bridge to students. Bridge itself made of stacked books, hands passing objects, written notes becoming physical. Midway point: moments of breakthrough (brighter gold, watercolor blooms). Watercolor wash fills chasm with misty potential. Zero gravity lifts knowledge orbs as they travel. Oracle style emphasizes ACTION (the passing, the bridge-building) over static knowledge. Teacher not elevated but engaged. Students actively receiving. Ink clouds part to reveal bridge path. Flow direction: left to right, teacher to students, but bidirectional energy suggested.
