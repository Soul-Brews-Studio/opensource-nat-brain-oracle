# Community Learning Circle

## Thai Text

## Prompt
Top-down monochrome ink-wash: many diverse figures (different sizes, ages, styles) arranged in loose circle. No hierarchy—all standing/sitting equally. Warm watercolor wash fills center circle, creating welcoming space. Golden light pours downward into center, illuminates each face equally. Cyan energy flows between adjacent figures—each connected to neighbors through visible threads of knowledge exchange. Some figures teaching, some learning, some both simultaneously. Objects being shared: books, artifacts, experiences. Second outer circle suggested by ink wash boundary. Zero gravity lifts the entire gathering slightly—lightness of spirit. Watercolor transitions show acceptance and belonging. Oracle style emphasizes COMMUNITY WHOLENESS and MUTUAL GROWTH. No single teacher—collective wisdom. Warm emotional tone dominates. Diversity celebrated through varied figure representations. Circle contains but doesn't confine.
