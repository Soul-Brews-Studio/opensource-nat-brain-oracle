# Worktree Architecture

## Thai Text
สถาปัตยกรรม Worktree
(Sat-ha-pat-ya-kam Worktree)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash monochrome showing a top-down floor plan with 5 separate rooms arranged in a cross pattern. Each room is connected by cyan dotted lines (representing git branches) leading to a central hub. Rooms contain minimal interior elements (table, chair icons) suggesting isolated workspaces. Gold lines mark room doorways and connection points. The central hub glows with cyan energy where all branches meet. Faint wash effects create depth. A "main" label in gold marks the central space, with "agents/1" through "agents/4" labels in gray for surrounding rooms. Hierarchical but distributed architecture. 16:9 aspect ratio, emphasizing isolation with orchestration.
```
