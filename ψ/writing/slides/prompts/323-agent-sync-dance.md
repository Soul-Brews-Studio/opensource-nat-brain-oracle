# Agent Sync Dance

## Thai Text
นาฏการผ่านการ Rebase
(Nat-ka-kam Paan Ga-kam Rebase)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash composition depicting choreographed movement. Center stage shows git commit objects as circles (some filled black for "main", some outlined in cyan for "agents/N"). Curved arrows loop from agents back to center, illustrating rebase operations. Each arrow has gold accent points where commits align. Five minimalist figures (agents) positioned around the composition perform synchronized reaching gestures toward central commit stack. Cyan flowing lines trace rebase pathways. Gold checkmarks appear at synchronization points. Light wash background with radial emphasis on central coordinate point. Dynamic yet balanced. 16:9 aspect ratio. Thai text "นาฏการ Rebase" bottom left in flowing script.
```
