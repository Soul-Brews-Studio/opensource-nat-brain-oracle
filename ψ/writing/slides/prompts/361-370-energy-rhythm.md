# Sprint → Recovery → Sprint

## Thai Text
วัฏจักรพลังงาน: ระเบิด → พักผ่อน → ระเบิด
(Wad-ja-gahn pah-lang-ngan: Rab-berd → Pug-pon → Rab-berd)
"Energy Cycle: Burst → Rest → Burst"

## Prompt
Monochrome ink-wash foundation depicting three interconnected phases in a horizontal flow.

**Left phase (SPRINT)**: Explosive burst of cyan energy radiating outward - sharp, jagged brushstrokes like electricity, figures in dynamic forward motion, intensity peaks shown as glowing cyan lines surging upward and outward.

**Center phase (RECOVERY)**: Graceful transition zone - cyan fades to softer washes, horizontal brushstrokes like settling waves, figures in restful poses, gold accents forming a gentle circle of completion around the resting figure, suggesting reflection and restoration.

**Right phase (SPRINT)**: Energy rebuilds - cyan returns with rhythmic pulses, figures recharge with renewed posture, gold threads weave through showing wisdom gained from recovery, ready for next burst.

The three phases connect via flowing curves, suggesting cyclical rather than linear motion. Ground line shows elevation changes - high during sprints, leveled during recovery. Subtle grid in background indicates time passage. Minimal ink washes anchor the composition while cyan and gold dance together through all three phases.

"Rest as Investment: Today's Rest = Tomorrow's Strength"

## Prompt
Monochrome ink-wash foundation depicting recovery as financial/energy investment with visible returns.

**Investment visualization**: Left side shows deliberate REST - figure in recovery posture, energy contained rather than expelled. Monochrome ink-wash shows cocooning, inward focus, quietude. Gold circle marks the decision point - choosing rest despite pressure to produce.

**Banking metaphor**: Cyan energy pooling and collecting during rest period - shown as accumulation, like funds gathering in account. Ink-wash shading suggests depth and reserve building.

**Compound returns**: Time passage shown as the rest period yields exponential returns. Right side shows figure emerging with multiplied capacity - cyan radiating outward with greater intensity than before rest.

**Visible output gain**: Gold markers on right side show tangible increased output - same effort produces better results because foundation was restored. Quality improvements, innovation increases, creativity flourishes.

**Multiple cycles**: Three cycles shown to demonstrate pattern - rest → growth → productivity → rest → greater growth. Each cycle builds on previous, compounding effect visible.

**Health markers**: Monochrome ink-wash shows physical restoration during rest - cellular repair depicted as fine detailed brushwork, suggesting microscopic renewal. Cyan shown flowing smoothly without turbulence, indicating healthy restoration.

**Future-orientation**: Composition tilts slightly upward on right side - showing forward trajectory enabled by investment in recovery. Future appears brighter because present rest was valued.

**Cost-benefit clarity**: No guilt imagery - recovery shown as pure asset, not luxury or weakness. Gold treats rest-days equally to work-days, emphasizing value parity.

**Cycle lock-in**: Small gold loops at completion points suggest once you understand this pattern, it becomes self-reinforcing - rest enables output, output creates capacity for more rest.
