# Review Gate Pattern

## Thai Text
ประตูการตรวจสอบ
(Pra-too Ga-kam Tro-vat-sop)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash monochrome showing a gatehouse architectural structure centered in composition. A large arched gateway in center with two pillars. Pull request symbol (simplified rectangle with arrow) approaches the gate from left. Inside the gate visible faintly: review checklist (small checkmarks), approval badge (gold star), and completion zone (more gold accents). To the sides of gate: two reviewer figures (circles with reviewing posture) examining the incoming PR. Cyan lines connect reviewers to the PR showing scrutiny. Gold light emanates from inside the gate indicating approval state. Outside left is darker zone (waiting area). The gate creates clear boundary between "pending" (left) and "approved" (right) states. 16:9 aspect ratio. Thai text "ประตูการตรวจสอบ" centered below gateway.
