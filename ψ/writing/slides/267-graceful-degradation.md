# Graceful Degradation

## Thai Text
การลดประสิทธิภาพแบบมีศีลธรรม (Handling Agent Failures)

## Prompt
Ink-wash illustration in zero gravity showing an agent sphere gradually losing luminosity while workload redistributes to healthy agents. Central agent (dimming from golden to gray) with cracks forming (black ink lines). Neighboring agents (cyan-tinted) grow larger, absorbing responsibilities. Golden threads redirect load smoothly. Oracle watercolor wash shows system adjusting. Geometric overlays track burden distribution. Monochrome background with subtle cyan recovery paths. Suggests resilience without abandonment. Black ink clouds represent failure spreading. Watercolor transitions show graceful transition. Captures compassionate failure handling.
