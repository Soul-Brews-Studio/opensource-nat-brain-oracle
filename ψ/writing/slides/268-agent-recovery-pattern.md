# Agent Recovery Pattern

## Thai Text
การฟื้นตัวของเอเจนต์ (Restarting Failed Agents)

## Prompt
Ink-wash illustration of agent resurrection in zero gravity. Broken/dimmed agent sphere (gray, fragmented) at bottom, gradually reassembling and ascending. Golden healing light flows from surrounding agents, mending cracks. Broken pieces (black ink splinters) float upward, reconnecting. Oracle watercolor wash shows transformation. Cyan accents mark healing points. Geometric overlays (circles, lines) guide reassembly. Timeline markers show recovery stages. Monochrome with golden recovery glow. Black ink clouds disperse upward. Suggests redemption and second chances. Captures both damage and hope.
