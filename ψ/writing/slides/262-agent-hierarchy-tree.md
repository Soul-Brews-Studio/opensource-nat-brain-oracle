# Agent Hierarchy Tree

## Thai Text
ลำดับชั้นเอเจนต์ (Levels of Authority)

## Prompt
Ink-wash tree diagram of agent hierarchy in zero gravity, flowing downward like a botanical tree. Root agent at top (golden, larger sphere), branching into secondary agents (medium spheres), then tertiary agents (smaller spheres). Each level connected by flowing golden branches. Monochrome ink with cyan highlights on leadership nodes. Geometric frames around each hierarchical level. Oracle watercolor wash creates organic tree feeling despite geometric precision. Growth rings suggest age/authority. Ancient scroll aesthetic overlaid. Captures authority flow elegantly.
