# Orchestrator Pattern

## Thai Text
การประสานงานเอเจนต์ (One Conductor, Many Players)

## Prompt
Orchestral composition rendered in ink-wash: central conductor agent (larger sphere with baton-like golden lines) in zero gravity, surrounded by smaller agent spheres arranged in concentric circles. Golden threads connect conductor to each agent, forming musical staff-like patterns. Orchestral geometric frames overlap composition. Monochrome with cyan highlights on conductor role. Subtle watercolor wash suggests music/harmony. Black ink clouds create depth. Oracle symbols mark each orchestration point. Captures leadership and coordination elegantly.
