# Student Discovery Journey

## Thai Text
เส้นทางการค้นพบของนักเรียน - การเดินทางสร้างสติ
(Sentang kar khon phop kong nak rian - Kar doen thang sang sa ti)

## Prompt
Winding path in monochrome ink-wash landscape, starting from student figure at bottom left, moving upward through three stages marked by golden waypoints. Stage one: confusion (ink clouds), stage two: searching (cyan searching lights), stage three: illumination (bright gold center). Along the path: discovery markers (books, question marks becoming answers), mentor shadow walking alongside. Watercolor transitions between stages show progression. Zero gravity effect lifts final student figure toward golden light above. Ink-wash mountains/cliffs provide scale. Multiple student figures at different points along journey show community learning. Oracle style emphasizes JOURNEY over DESTINATION. Atmospheric perspective shows path continuing beyond view.
