# Peek Monitoring Dashboard - Watching All Agents

## Thai Text
มองเข้าไปดู | แdashboard สำหรับเฝ้าระวังแต่ละแอจเอนต์

## Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash illustration resembling a control room dashboard with multiple circular monitor screens (like a starfield or radar display). Each circular monitor shows real-time activity of different agents (rendered as simplified abstract patterns: sine waves, geometric animations, progress rings). The central monitor is larger and gold-accented. All monitors are connected by fine cyan lines suggesting data feeds. Around the perimeter: status indicators, gauges, and small graphs rendered in minimal geometric style. The wash background suggests motion and active surveillance. Hands or eyes (stylized as simple geometric forms) peer at the dashboard from the edges, representing the observer. The composition uses depth (some monitors closer, some farther) to suggest active scanning. Style: Vintage control room meets contemporary data visualization.
