### Prompt
A radar or sonar visualization rendered in monochrome ink-wash showing concentric circular scan lines emanating from a central point (the sensor device). Heavy black lines form the radar grid. Cyan energy pulses outward in rings from center, showing active detection scanning. Target objects appear as simple geometric shapes (circles, squares) within the scan zone, rendered in gray with subtle gradients. Where targets are detected, cyan highlighting intensifies and gold markers appear. The outer circles fade into soft ink-wash suggestion of extended range beyond visible detection. Small hexagonal shape at center represents the ESP device (abstract stylized form). Detection history shown as fading ghost rings - previous scans shown in lighter gray behind active scans. Right edge shows data readout as minimal vertical bars and numbers (Thai numerals in Kanit font). Radial lines create sense of motion and active scanning. 16:9 composition with radar centered slightly left of image center, scan zone extending right.
