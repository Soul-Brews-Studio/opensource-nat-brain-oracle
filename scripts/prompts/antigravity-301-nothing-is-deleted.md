### Prompt

```
Create a geological cross-section view showing Earth's layered strata, with each layer representing a different time period.

Composition: Center the strata layers vertically, left side shows compressed older layers becoming clearer toward the surface. A human figure stands at ground level on the right, holding a magnifying glass examining a single exposed layer.

Monochrome ink-wash base with heavily textured charcoal lines representing rock formations. Cyan colored veins running vertically through the layers like water flows—showing continuous streams of data/time moving upward. Gold accents highlighting key temporal markers and the magnifying glass lens.

Style reference: Geological survey atlas meets data visualization—scientific precision with philosophical weight. The layering emphasizes nothing is truly lost; everything descends but remains visible.

Bottom text overlay in Kanit font:
"ประวัติศาสตร์ = บันทึกเท่านั้น"
("History = Record Only")

--ar 16:9
--q 2
```

### Expected Output
- Format: PNG
- File: results/301-nothing-is-deleted-strata.png
- Dimensions: 1920x1080px (16:9)
