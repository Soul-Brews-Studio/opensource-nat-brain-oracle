# Marie Kondo Consultant - File Placement

## Thai Text
ที่ปรึกษาการจัดเรียง: ต้องไป ที่ไหน?

(Organization Consultant: Where Does This Go?)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash illustration showing a contemplative figure holding a folder or document, standing before
a multi-tiered shelf structure. Each shelf labeled with purpose: "Active", "Writing", "Lab", "Learn",
"Incubate".

The figure is positioned at the center intersection, with gentle query lines radiating outward like
a compass rose, each pointing to different shelf categories. Golden accents trace the decision paths,
forming a soft mandala-like pattern.

Background shows faint file icons gently floating or arranged in organized rows, suggesting categorization
in progress. Semi-transparent cyan circles around each shelf indicating "joy" or appropriateness - brighter
cyan where items truly belong.

Monochrome ink base with touches of gold at decision junctions. Include subtle geometric grid beneath
the shelves. Style: Zen minimalism meets information architecture diagram.

Text overlay in corner: "sparks joy?" in flowing script.
