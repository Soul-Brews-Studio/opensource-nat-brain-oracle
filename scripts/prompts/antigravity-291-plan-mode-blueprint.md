# Plan Mode Blueprint - Planning Before Coding

## Thai Text
โหมดแผน: คิด → ออกแบบ → ก่อสร้าง

(Plan Mode: Think → Design → Build)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash architectural blueprint scene showing a figure hunched over a large drafting table or
drawing surface, meticulously sketching plans with compass, ruler, and precision instruments.

The table surface displays evolving blueprints with multiple iterations: rough sketches at the top,
progressively more refined technical drawings moving downward, ending in detailed construction plans
at the bottom. Each iteration layer connected by transparent cyan flow lines showing refinement progression.

Above the figure's head, a conceptual cloud or thought balloon contains abstract geometric shapes
and problem decompositions - representing mental modeling before execution. Golden lines trace the
thinking process, showing how concepts become blueprints.

Surrounding the drafting table: reference materials, specifications, requirements lists, all rendered
in precise geometric style. Tools labeled with purpose: "Decompose", "Validate", "Sequence", "Risk".

The figure's focus is intense and contemplative, with semi-transparent cyan highlights around areas
of concentration and breakthrough thinking.

Background suggests an architecture office or research laboratory with grid-lined walls. Monochrome
ink with geometric frameworks representing structured thinking. Include subtle timeline markers showing
planning phases progressing left-to-right.

Foreground shows finalized blueprints rolling up with golden seals, ready for handoff to builders.

Style: Renaissance workshop meets modern design thinking, methodical precision.
