# Kill Command - Graceful Agent Termination

## Thai Text
คำสั่งยุติ | การสิ้นสุดอย่างสงบเรียบร้อย

## Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash illustration showing an agent (geometric form: circle, hexagon, or humanoid shape made of lines) that is gently dissolving or fading. The process is shown in stages from left (solid/active) to right (fading/transparent). At the center, delicate curved lines (resembling cherry blossoms falling or paper dissolving in water) show the peaceful deconstruction. The dissolving pieces fall downward gracefully, not chaotically. Rays of gold light (from above) illuminate the dissolution, giving it spiritual/serene quality. At the base, the dissolved elements settle into a calm pool (represented by concentric circles and wash). The background uses gradual wash transitions suggesting a peaceful sunset. Include a gentle spiral or mandala pattern showing the return of resources to a central point. The overall feeling should be respectful and peaceful, not violent. Style: Buddhist iconography meets technical diagram.
