### Prompt

Monochrome ink-wash foundation with urgent cyan energy flows. Central composition: A runner in dark silhouette sprinting rightward through a mountainous terrain, but the path ahead disappears into white mist. Gold circular markers illuminate patches of ground immediately ahead and a dangerous cliff edge ahead, but the runner's momentum carries them forward blindly. Cyan streaks flow around the figure suggesting speed and urgency. In the negative space above, faint ink-wash shadows hint at consequences—fallen forms, broken structures—that the rushing figure cannot see. The gold circle at the cliff edge glows with warning but arrives too late in the visual narrative. Bottom text in gold: "SPEED ≠ SEEING" with Thai: "ความเร็ว ≠ การมองเห็น"
