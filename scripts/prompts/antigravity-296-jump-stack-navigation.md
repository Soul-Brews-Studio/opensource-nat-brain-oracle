# Jump Stack Navigation - Topic Switching

## Thai Text
กระโดด: บันทึก → เปลี่ยน → กลับ

(Jump: Save → Switch → Return)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash illustration of a figure mid-leap between multiple floating platforms or islands, each
platform representing a different topic or context. The figure is captured suspended in air at the
apex of a jump, with one foot pushing off from previous platform, the other extending toward next.

Each platform is rendered as a stable geometric island with distinct visual identity: different
heights, sizes, and surrounding auras. Semi-transparent cyan brackets show the "stack" of recent
contexts - a vertical alignment of platforms behind the current leap, growing fainter with distance.

The figure carries a bundle or package on back, representing the "state" or "context" being transported
between platforms - monochrome ink-rendered items marked with golden security bands.

Visual metaphor of a jump stack: previous platforms shown in decreasing size/opacity going backward,
creating perspective effect. The active platform (about to jump to) is brightest and most detailed.
Future platforms (not yet jumped to) fade into misty distance.

Energy arcs trace the path of the jump, with golden accents highlighting launch point and landing zone.
Semi-transparent cyan circles mark transition moments and potential fall-back points.

Background suggests a vast landscape with many more platforms visible but unreachable - representing
the infinite context management problem and careful focus on current stack.

Include symbolic representation of stack operations: push (jumping forward), pop (jumping back),
peek (looking ahead). Text overlay: "Context preserved".

Foreground shows a landing platform solidifying and stabilizing as figure commits to new context.
Include small safety ropes or threads connecting to previous platforms, suggesting quick return capability.

Style: Parkour precision meets stack data structure, contextual agility.
