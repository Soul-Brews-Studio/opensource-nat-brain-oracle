# Agent Birth Lifecycle

## Thai Text
วัฏจักรชีวิต Worktree
(Vat-ja-gak Chi-wit Worktree)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash monochrome showing horizontal lifecycle progression from left to right. Four stages represented as vertical segments: (1) "Birth" - empty circle with cyan spark, (2) "Create" - circle with branching lines emanating outward in cyan, (3) "Work" - circle with busy internal activity (small marks, gold checkpoints), (4) "Cleanup" - circle dissolving into light wash (fade effect). Agent figure transitions through each stage, growing in stage 2-3, shrinking in stage 4. Connecting pathway flows through stages marked by gold progress indicators. Faint text labels below each stage. Surrounding space in subtle wash gradient suggesting time flow. 16:9 aspect ratio emphasizing temporal progression. Thai text "วัฏจักร Worktree" bottom center.
```
