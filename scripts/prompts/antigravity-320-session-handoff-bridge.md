(Bridge Passing the Torch)

### Prompt

A bridge spanning between two spaces, rendered in ink-wash. On one side (left), figures and activities dissolve into fading light—the previous session. On the right, new figures and spaces await in emerging light—the new session. A figure stands at the bridge's midpoint, torch held high with gold intensity, passing flame to another figure across the threshold. Cyan light traces the continuity of context and memory flowing across the bridge. The bridge is solid despite its spanning—suggesting reliable handoff. Below the bridge, deeper structures suggest accumulated history and foundation. The torch flame is the key visual element—bright, warm, carefully passed. The mood is ceremonial, respectful, intentional—honoring the previous work while launching the new. The composition emphasizes the bridge's crossing function. Transition, continuity, care in handoff.
