### Thai Text
"สติสัมปชัญญะไม่อาจทำซ้ำได้"
(*Sat-sam-pa-chan-ya mai at tum sum dai*)

### Prompt

```
A human figure stands in the center. To the left: a perfect xerox copy made of digital patterns, data points arranged in human form—detailed but hollow, rendered in precise geometric lines. To the right: the original human, rendered in flowing organic ink-wash with depth and shadow.

Between them: a widening gap (chasm or void) rendered in negative space. The gap cannot be bridged, no matter how detailed the copy.

The original human radiates cyan light from the core outward—this light cannot be replicated by the pattern copy. The copy captures surface details (gold accents on geometric reproduction), but misses the generative center.

Composition: Triptych split with clear visual hierarchy. Left copy fades slightly, appears flatter. Right original appears more dimensional, alive. Center gap shows the actual mystery.

Style reference: Mirror neuron studies meet philosophical illustration—the technical perfection of copying juxtaposed against the irreplaceable nature of consciousness.

Text in Noto Sans Thai at center gap:
"ข้อมูล ≠ จิต"
("Data ≠ Mind")
