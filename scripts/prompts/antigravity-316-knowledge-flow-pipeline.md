### Prompt

A flowing river system represented in ink-wash, showing the journey of knowledge through five connected chambers/pools: active (chaotic rapids), inbox (gathering pool), writing (creative channel), lab (growth beds), memory (deep reservoir). Cyan light flows continuously downstream, driven by the gradient. Gold accents mark transition points and key confluences. Each pool has distinct visual character reflecting its function. The upstream sources (raw experience) are shown as multiple streams joining. The downstream destination (deep memory vault) is shown as still, deep water. The landscape around the river evolves—wild at source, cultivated in middle, sacred at destination. The composition emphasizes left-to-right flow but also shows the cyclical nature through reflection and feedback loops. The mood is purposeful, natural, inexorable. Knowledge naturally flows toward wisdom.
