### Prompt

A camera's aperture freezing a moment mid-motion. Ink-wash background with flowing water or mist being crystallized in place. Cyan light rays converge through the lens, sharp and precise, capturing ephemeral thoughts and patterns. The moment being frozen is complex—overlapping threads, ideas, connections—but the camera distills it into clarity. Gold light marks the edges of the captured frame, suggesting preservation and value. Around the frame's edges, time continues flowing in darker wash tones, but inside the frame everything is held in crystalline stillness. Minimalist, contemplative, decisive.
