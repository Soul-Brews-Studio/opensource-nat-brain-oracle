# Context Preservation Vault

## Thai Text
ห้องเก็บ Context: ความปลอดภัย + การเข้าถึง

(Context Vault: Safety + Access)

## Prompt
```
Fortress-like vault rendered in monochrome ink showing context preservation as sacred
architecture. Golden and cyan accents mark security layers and access points.

THE VAULT STRUCTURE (center):
Large circular or rectangular vault with thick black ink walls. Interior divided into
concentric security rings, each progressively finer as you move inward.

OUTER RINGS (Protection):
- RING 1 (outermost): Black ink fortress walls with geometric crenellations
- Golden perimeter line shows the security boundary
- Cyan checkmarks at cardinal points mark verification/authentication checkpoints
- Small ink dots represent monitoring sensors

- RING 2: Compartment dividers shown as finer black lines
  Each compartment labeled with context type: "session", "user", "project", "system"
  Cyan gates between compartments show access control points
  Golden locks on critical compartments

- RING 3: Fine lattice work (geometric pattern) showing encryption/encoding of data
  Cyan threads show data access paths weaving through lattice
  Golden highlights on frequently accessed nodes

INNERMOST SANCTUARY (center):
Gleaming golden core representing the current active context. Surrounded by protective
cyan aurora/energy field. This is the most valuable and protected data.

DATA FLOWS (around vault):
- Input: Text flowing into vault through golden intake tube, passing through all rings
- Output: Authorized access shown by cyan beams projecting outward at specific angles
- Denied access: Red/dark lines showing blocked attempts

VAULT MECHANICS:
- Top: Rotating lock mechanism in geometric ink, showing active re-encryption
- Bottom: Foundation seal with timestamp, showing "last access" and "next validation"
- Sides: Access logs scrolling in tiny text (barely readable), showing audit trail

SUPPORTING ELEMENTS:
- Guardian figures (minimalist ink) standing at cardinal points
- Small oracle symbol in corner showing "trust through transparency" principle
- Backup indicators (small golden duplicates) showing redundancy/safety

STYLE: Medieval fortress meets cutting-edge security visualization. Heavy black ink
for strength and security, golden/cyan accents for active security processes.
Geometric precision suggesting algorithmic security, organic ink wash suggesting
holistic protection philosophy. Abundant protective symbolism.
