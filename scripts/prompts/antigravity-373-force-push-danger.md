### Prompt

Stark monochrome composition with violent cyan energy. Central focus: A thick, ancient tree branch rendered in dark ink. A destructive golden fist or hammer crashes into it with cyan electrical impact lines radiating outward. The branch is splintering—but the damage extends beyond the point of impact. Behind the breaking branch, the entire tree is shown as translucent ink-wash, and thin tendrils of connection (shown in cyan) run through all parts of the organism. The shattering at one point creates cascading fractures throughout the whole system. Fallen twigs and debris scatter below. The impact zone glows ominously in gold warning.
