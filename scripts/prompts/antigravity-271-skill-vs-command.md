# Skill vs Command Spectrum

## Thai Text
กระบวนการเลือก: ทักษะ ↔ คำสั่ง

(Decision Flow: Skill ↔ Command)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash vector illustration showing a horizontal spectrum with two poles. Left pole labeled "Skill"
with organic, flowing brushstroke forms suggesting human expertise and intuition. Right pole labeled
"Command" with sharp geometric angles and precise linework suggesting automation and structure.

Between them, a gradient of ascending bars from left to right, each representing decision points.
Overlaid are transparent cyan circles showing when each approach is appropriate - cyan halos cluster
more on the left for complex decisions, more on the right for routine tasks.

Golden accents trace the "decision boundary" - a flowing line that shifts based on context.
Monochrome ink background with subtle grid. Style: Japanese zen + technical diagram hybrid.

Foreground shows two figures: left figure uses intuition (wavy energy lines),
right figure triggers automation (precise data flows).

Small text overlays in top corners: "Complex" (left), "Routine" (right)
