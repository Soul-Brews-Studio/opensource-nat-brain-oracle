# Incubation Lifecycle

## Thai Text
วงจร Incubate: แนวคิด → พัฒนา → จบการศึกษา

(Lifecycle: Idea → Develop → Graduate)

## Prompt
```
Elegant transformation diagram showing project incubation as a natural lifecycle process.
Monochrome ink with cyan and golden accents marking transition points and maturity stages.

THREE MAJOR PHASES arranged left to right with flowing connections:

PHASE 1: IDEA (left third):
Show as a sprouting seed breaking through soil. Ink wash creates organic emerging form.
Small delicate lines suggest fragility and potential. Cyan glow around the seed represents
excitement and possibility. Golden question marks float nearby showing exploration.
Labels: "Concept", "Sketch", "Exploration"

PHASE 2: INCUBATE (center third):
Seed transforms into developing plant with visible growth. Show as botanical illustration
in fine ink lines. Multiple growth rings visible, suggesting time passage and development.
Golden connectors show nutrient/energy flow from surrounding soil (context).
Cyan highlights show development checkpoints: "structure forming", "testing", "refinement"

Detailed elements:
- Root system reaching downward (into ghq, git infrastructure)
- Stems and branches reaching upward (toward graduation)
- Leaves unfurling (new features emerging)
- Fine ink veining showing internal complexity developing

PHASE 3: GRADUATION (right third):
Mature plant or butterfly (metamorphosis) emerging. Show transformation with golden
light breaking through. Cyan rays suggest expansion into larger ecosystem.
Plant transplanted to "new garden" (standalone repo) OR butterfly taking flight
(becoming independent project).

Labels: "Maturity", "Launch", "Independence"

CONNECTING FLOWS (between phases):
- Golden vines showing growth continuation from phase to phase
- Cyan pulses showing energy/momentum transfer
- Fine timeline markers showing typical duration

SURROUNDING CONTEXT:
- Top: Watering can (inputs: design, code, tests) providing nourishment in golden stream
- Bottom: Soil layer in ink wash showing "growing medium" (ghq, plugin ecosystem)
- Left side: Small comparison showing "before incubation" vs current state
- Right side: Expanded view showing graduation options (multiple graduation paths)

TEMPORAL ELEMENTS:
- Subtle date/timestamp markers along the growth timeline
- Sun position changing overhead (day progression suggesting time passage)
- Growth rings on plant trunk showing seasonal cycles

BOTTOM: Small oracle symbol with principle "Ideas are seeds, patience is gardening"

STYLE: Botanical illustration meets project lifecycle diagram. Organic growth forms with
precise geometric progress markers. Heavy use of ink wash for natural emergence, golden/cyan
for process milestones. Abundant whitespace suggesting room for growth.
