# MAW Control Loop - Complete Cycle

## Thai Text
ลูปควบคุม | เริ่ม-ทำงาน-ซิงค์-รวมเข้า

## Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash illustration showing a circular flow diagram representing the complete MAW cycle: START → WORK → SYNC → MERGE → (back to START). The cycle is rendered as a large circle divided into four distinct quadrants, each representing a phase.

QUADRANT 1 (START): Shows a central spark or ignition point (gold starburst), agents spawning outward
QUADRANT 2 (WORK): Shows agents in parallel, each engaged in distinct tasks (flowing lines, movement)
QUADRANT 3 (SYNC): Shows convergence and realignment (rebase visualization from earlier prompts)
QUADRANT 4 (MERGE): Shows integration into a unified whole, completion and merging back

Between each quadrant: curved arrow flow lines in gold and cyan. The center contains a glowing core (representing shared soul/memory). Around the outer edge: geometric nodes representing process checkpoints. The background uses layered wash to suggest rotation/cycling motion. Include fine detail showing knowledge/data flowing around the loop. Style: Systems thinking meets circular philosophy (无).
