### Prompt

Monochrome ink-wash showing a system reaching breaking point. Central composition: A container or vessel (rendered in dark ink lines) receiving relentless cyan energy streams flowing inward—arrows, particles, waves—all representing API requests pouring in. The container fills rapidly, shown by rising ink-wash water level. Gold warning markers highlight the vessel's capacity limit, now exceeded. The system begins to fracture: ink-wash cracks spread from the stress. At the top, a release valve or pressure release (shown in gold) opens too late. Cyan energy explodes outward violently, shown as chaotic tendrils and spray. Below the vessel, downstream systems (shown as smaller structures) are flooded or destroyed by the overflow. The composition emphasizes: rate of inflow > capacity to process. A figure trying to control the flow (pale ink-wash) looks desperate, hands raised in futility. The crash is inevitable and visible. Text: "DEMAND > CAPACITY" with Thai: "ความต้องการ > ความสามารถ"
