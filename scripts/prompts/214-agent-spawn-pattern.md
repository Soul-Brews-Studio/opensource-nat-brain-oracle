# Agent Spawn Pattern - Main Creating Subagents

## Thai Text
หลักแม่สร้างตัวกลม | บิดาแม่สร้างสร้าง

## Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash illustration showing a large central circle (main agent, rendered in bold geometric style) with multiple smaller circles radiating outward in a precise mathematical pattern (like a dandelion seed head or atomic structure). Each small circle represents a spawned subagent, connected to the main circle by flowing lines that branch like a tree. The connection lines start bold and gold from the center, then transform to cyan as they extend outward. The spawning event is captured with motion lines and burst patterns (like speed lines in manga). The background uses subtle wash gradients suggesting temporal flow from center (past) to edges (future). Some subagents are larger/dimmer, representing different lifecycle stages. Style: Abstract biology meets technical diagram.
