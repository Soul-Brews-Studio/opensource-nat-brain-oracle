### Prompt
A structural blueprint rendered in ink-wash showing interconnected geometric forms (circles, squares, hexagons) stacked and arranged vertically like architectural layers or strata. Darkest blacks form the core central structure. Gray wash creates planes and depth between layers. Each layer represents a different system component or abstraction level. Cyan connecting lines show energy flow and information pathways vertically and horizontally through the structure. Gold reinforcement points highlight critical junctions and completed integration points. Small Thai text labels (Sarabun font) identifying layers: foundation, abstraction, interface, orchestration. The entire structure radiates outward from a central core nexus in the bottom center. Right side shows ascending complexity and capability gain. Left side grounds structure in fundamentals. Ethereal quality with soft edges transitioning from pure white outer edges to deep black core. 16:9 landscape with structure occupying center and lower-middle region, allowing breathing room above.

**Expected Output**: PNG 1920x1080, saved as `results/387-nat-agents-core.png`
