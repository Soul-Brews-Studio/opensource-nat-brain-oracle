# Hook System Chain

## Thai Text
โซ่ระบบ Hook: ก่อน → กลาง → หลัง

(Hook Chain: Pre → Mid → Post)

## Prompt
```
Horizontal flowing chain diagram in monochrome ink showing hook execution sequence. Three distinct
zones marked by golden vertical accents:

PRE-HOOK zone (left): Shows delicate branching tree roots in ink wash, representing setup and
validation. Cyan circle marks "pre-conditions check" node.

MID-HOOK zone (center): Heavy bold ink stroke creates the main processing block, geometric and
solid. Golden connector lines pull data through.

POST-HOOK zone (right): Fine ink lines diverge outward like water ripples, representing cleanup
and side effects. Cyan accents show distributed notifications firing.

Each hook connected by decorative chain links (geometric circles and lines, alternating).
Between zones: small data packets flowing left-to-right shown as golden dots on flowing paths.
Errors shown as breaks in the chain with cyan warning symbols.

Monochrome ink with generous whitespace. Bottom shows timestamp markers in small text.
Style: Technical schematic meets abstract ink calligraphy.
