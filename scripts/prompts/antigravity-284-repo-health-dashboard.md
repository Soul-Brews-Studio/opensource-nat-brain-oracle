# Repo Health Check Dashboard

## Thai Text
แดชบอร์ด: ตรวจสุขภาพ Repository

(Dashboard: Repository Vitals)

## Prompt
```
Medical/dashboard monitoring interface showing repository health metrics rendered as an
analog/digital hybrid dashboard. Monochrome ink with golden gauges and cyan vital signs.
Suggests both traditional instrument panel and health monitoring system.

DASHBOARD LAYOUT (symmetric, organized):
Central focal point with six surrounding metric zones arranged like a hexagon or wheel.
Heavy black frame suggesting device casing. Decorative golden border.

CENTRAL READOUT (core):
Large circular gauge in center showing overall repository health score as percentage.
- Concentric circles showing thresholds (green zone at top, yellow middle, red bottom)
- Golden needle pointing to current health level
- Cyan digital readout showing numeric value (e.g., "87%")
- Small ink wash background suggesting live monitoring

SURROUNDING METRICS (six zones):

ZONE 1 (Top): Code Quality Score
- Vertical bar chart in ink showing complexity metrics
- Golden highlights showing "safe" levels, cyan showing current value
- Small icons showing: coverage %, maintainability index, technical debt
- Trend arrow (golden up/down) showing direction of change

ZONE 2 (Top-Right): Test Coverage
- Circular progress indicator (target 100%) shown as pie chart
- Cyan fill showing current coverage, white showing gap
- Golden ring outline
- Small test icons (unit, integration, e2e) with checkmarks
- Numbers: "2,847 tests" in fine text

ZONE 3 (Bottom-Right): Dependency Health
- Network graph visualization showing dependency relationships
- Golden primary dependencies (core libraries), cyan secondary
- Red highlights showing outdated packages
- Version numbers shown on each node
- Security audit indicators (shields) showing vulnerability status

ZONE 4 (Bottom): Performance Metrics
- Multi-line chart showing build times, test times, deployment times
- Golden historical trend (fading back in time), cyan current
- Threshold lines showing acceptable ranges
- Time in minutes/seconds marked on axes

ZONE 5 (Bottom-Left): Commit Activity
- Timeline bar chart showing commits over past months
- Golden spikes showing high activity periods
- Cyan indicators showing release points
- Frequency metrics: "avg 12 commits/week"

ZONE 6 (Top-Left): Security Status
- Checklist style display with checkmarks and X marks
- Golden checks for secure practices implemented
- Red X marks for vulnerabilities found
- Items: secret scanning, branch protection, code review, audit logging
- Last scan timestamp with golden timestamp marker

SECONDARY DISPLAYS (around edges):

TOP BAR: Status indicators line
- Green/yellow/red lights showing: Build ✓, Tests ✓, Lint ✓, Security ✓, Deploy ✓
- Cyan dots between indicators suggesting flow of status
- Timestamp showing "Last updated: 3 min ago"

LEFT EDGE: Recent events log
- Tiny text listing recent commits, alerts, changes
- Golden highlights for important events
- Cyan scroll indicator showing there are more events

RIGHT EDGE: Alert/Warning panel
- Golden warning symbols for items needing attention
- Cyan info icons for FYI items
- Red alert symbols for critical issues (if any)
- Each with brief text and timestamp

BOTTOM PANEL: Predictions and Recommendations
- Golden trend projections showing where metrics are heading
- Cyan suggested actions ("Run tests", "Update dependencies", "Review code review queue")
- Oracle insight (small faded symbol) suggesting intelligent analysis

AESTHETIC TOUCHES:

Analog/Digital Hybrid:
- Mix of needle gauges (analog) with digital readouts (numeric)
- Mechanical grid patterns in background suggesting instrument panel
- Fine ink line work on borders suggesting precision crafted device

Color Coding:
- Golden: Primary metrics, thresholds, positive trends
- Cyan: Current values, active monitoring, suggested actions
- Black: Structural elements, baseline measurements
- Red (minimal): Critical alerts, failed metrics
- White: Empty/gap areas, transparent background

Typography:
- Metric labels in clean sans-serif
- Values in monospace (suggesting digital readout)
- Tiny timestamps in minimal script

INFORMATION DENSITY:
Dashboard shows exactly what's needed without clutter. Whitespace around metrics
suggests calm, organized monitoring. Absence of unnecessary decoration emphasizes
data clarity.

SURROUNDING CONTEXT (small corner notes):
- Upper-left: Legend key showing metric meanings
- Upper-right: Repository name, branch, date/time
- Lower-left: Contact info for repo maintainer
- Lower-right: Oracle principle: "Health is measured, not assumed"

DYNAMIC ELEMENTS (suggested via visual language):
- Subtle ink wash gradients suggesting animated transitions
- Golden pulse around critical metrics (suggesting real-time update)
- Cyan flowing lines between zones suggesting data flow
- Fading ink elements at edges suggesting changes/updates happening

STYLE: Medical ECG monitor meets software health dashboard. Analog instrument panel
precision combined with digital readout clarity. Monochrome ink providing professional,
clinical appearance. Golden accents on measured values, cyan on active monitoring.
Geometric grid patterns for technical rigor, organic ink wash for intelligent analysis.
Heavy use of whitespace and symmetry for clarity and calm confidence in system health.
