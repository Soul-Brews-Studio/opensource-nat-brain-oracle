ความผิดพลาดที่ลับซ่อน

Hidden Errors Buried Deep

### Prompt

Dark ink-wash foundation with minimal visibility. Central concept: A murky, polluted stream or underground passage (monochrome with dark grays). Cyan warning signals—errors, exceptions, alerts—flow through the water like glowing toxic particles, but they are redirected downward and muffled, shown as dark wisps disappearing into black earth/void. The redirection is visual: `2>/dev/null` represented as a drain pipe, dark and absolute, swallowing the warnings. Above ground, shown in the upper portion with lighter ink, everything appears calm and normal. A figure (shown in pale ink-wash) walks peacefully overhead, unaware. But the accumulated toxins below (accumulated failures) are pooling, darkening, suggesting catastrophe. The contrast between the peaceful surface and the hidden chaos below is stark. Hairline cracks in the surface hint at the breaking point. Text: "SILENCE ≠ SAFETY" with Thai: "ความเงียบ ≠ ความปลอดภัย"
