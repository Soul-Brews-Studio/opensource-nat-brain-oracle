Conflicting Branches Collide
```

### Prompt

Dynamic, turbulent ink-wash composition showing collision. Central image: Multiple dark, organic branches or paths (monochrome ink-wash) flowing from different directions, all converging at a single point. The point of convergence is a violent explosion of cyan and gold—chaotic, tangled lines representing merge conflicts. The branches show different edits: one path has gold markings showing changes, another path has different gold markings in the same locations. Where they collide, cyan sparks and tension lines radiate outward. The merged result is shown below as a mangled, broken structure—ink-wash rendering that looks incoherent. Parallel edits in the same region are shown as overlapping gold highlights, impossible to reconcile visually. The background shows the timeline branching and diverging further, with more cyan tension at each divergence point. Text: "PARALLEL ≠ COMPATIBLE" with Thai: "ขนาน ≠ เข้ากัน"
