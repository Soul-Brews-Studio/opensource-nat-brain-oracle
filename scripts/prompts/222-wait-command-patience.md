# Wait Command Patience - Agent Waiting for Others

## Thai Text
คำสั่งรอ | การรอคอยอย่างอดทน

## Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash illustration showing an agent (geometric form) in a static, meditative posture (like a seated figure or centered circle). Around the agent, swirling lines and curves create a vortex or spiral pattern suggesting the passage of time. In the background, multiple other agents are shown (smaller, farther away) engaged in their tasks. Connecting lines from the waiting agent radiate outward in a web pattern, showing connections to working agents. A large hourglass or clock face (rendered with precise geometry) dominates the center, with sand or time flowing through. Gold accents highlight the waiting agent and the hourglass. The composition uses repetitive curved lines to suggest cyclical time. Subtle wash layers in the background create depth. The waiting agent glows softly (cyan), showing patient readiness. Style: Zen meditation meets time-lapse photography.
