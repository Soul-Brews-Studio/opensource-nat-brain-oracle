### Prompt

Multiple figures or a singular figure fragmented into parallel instances, each executing a different task simultaneously, rendered in ink-wash. The figures are arranged horizontally or vertically in parallel columns, each running their own process but all synchronized. Cyan light flows through each pipeline like electricity or fluid through conduits, connecting the parallel streams. Each executor figure holds or works with different tools—some typing, some processing data, some moving materials—but all moving in coordinated rhythm. Gold highlights mark completed tasks dropping off the end of each pipeline. Between the pipelines, subtle connection threads show coordination and synchronization. The background shows a factory or processing floor in wash tones—industrial but elegant. No congestion or collision; each stream flows smoothly. The composition emphasizes horizontal distribution and coordinated parallel work. Efficient, rhythmic, organized, powerful.
