### Prompt

A circular chamber rendered in ink-wash minimalism, walls lined with open archives and open books. The interior glows with dynamic cyan light that swirls and curves, tracing active investigation pathways. Papers and ideas float mid-air, caught in the cyan currents—ephemeral, in motion, not yet categorized. Gold light illuminates the center where a figure leans over a table, hands actively reaching, gesturing, pointing at emerging patterns. The chamber has high ceilings suggesting limitless exploration. Windows frame distant undefined horizons. Dust particles catch cyan light mid-swirl. The mood is energetic, open-ended, questioning—research not yet concluded. The composition emphasizes active process over final product. Contemplative energy, unstable equilibrium.
