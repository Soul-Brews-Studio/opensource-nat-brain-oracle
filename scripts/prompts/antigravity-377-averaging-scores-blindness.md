### Prompt

Monochrome ink-wash composition showing a distribution. Bottom foreground: Multiple ink-wash bars or data points of wildly varying heights, some very tall (gold-tinted) showing outliers, some very short (dark ink), showing extremes—high variance, important outliers. A line or plane passes horizontally through the middle in gold, labeled "AVERAGE." Above this line, ink-wash clouds obscure the tops of the tall bars—the outliers are hidden in fog or dark clouds. Below the line, the short bars fade into shadow. The average line glows with false certainty in gold, but it reveals nothing true about the actual distribution. A figure in pale ink-wash stands behind the average line, hands raised in false confidence, seeing only the line. Cyan arrows from the hidden outliers point downward, suggesting "missed signals." Text: "MEAN HIDES EXTREMES" with Thai: "ค่าเฉลี่ย ซ่อนค่าสุดขั้ว"
