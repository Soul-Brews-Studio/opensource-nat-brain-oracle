# Tmux Pane Navigation

## Thai Text
นำทาง Tmux Panes
(Nam-thang Tmux Panes)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash grid layout showing a 3x3 tmux window configuration. Nine rectangular panes arranged in grid formation with thin monochrome borders. One pane (center) has bright cyan glow around border indicating current focus. Other panes contain subtle content representations: terminal text lines (small horizontal marks), activity indicators (faint dots). Gold arrows point from center pane toward adjacent panes showing navigation directions. Some panes are dimmed (lighter wash) showing inactive state, center pane is crisp and dark showing active state. Each pane subtly labeled (1-9). Surrounding negative space. 16:9 aspect ratio with slight landscape bias. Thai text "Tmux Panes" top left in minimal font.
```
