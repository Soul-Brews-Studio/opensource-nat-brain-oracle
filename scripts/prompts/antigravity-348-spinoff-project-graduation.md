### Thai Text
**นกปล่อยจากรัง**
(Bird Leaving the Nest)

### Prompt

A young bird launching from its nest into open sky, painted in ink-wash. The nest is rendered in dark, woven detail below. The bird is captured mid-takeoff, wings spread wide, with cyan light streaming beneath the wings showing lift and buoyancy. Gold outlines trace the bird's form and the path of flight. The sky above is open and white, full of possibility. Beneath the nest, clouds or landscape suggest the drop, the risk. The bird's eye is bright and determined. Wind currents suggested through curved air lines. The composition emphasizes upward motion and liberation. The nest remains below—still there, still safe, but the bird has moved beyond it. Hopeful, brave, transformative.
