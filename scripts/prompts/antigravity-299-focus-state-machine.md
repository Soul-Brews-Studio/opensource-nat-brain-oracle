# Focus State Machine - Working → Focusing → Pending

## Thai Text
สถานะสมาธิ: ทำ ↔ ตั้งใจ ↔ รอ

(Focus State: Working ↔ Focusing ↔ Pending)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash state diagram showing a figure moving through three distinct states, each represented as
a distinct space or chamber. The figure cycles through states, connected by flowing transition paths
marked with golden lines.

State 1 - WORKING: Figure at desk or workstation, actively engaged with multiple simultaneous tasks.
Rendered with moderate detail, semi-transparent cyan auras around workspace suggesting multi-threaded
attention. Arrows pointing inward suggest tasks arriving and being distributed.

State 2 - FOCUSING: Figure in deep concentration, centered in a zen garden or isolated chamber.
Maximum detail and clarity, monochrome ink with precise geometric focus point. Semi-transparent cyan
dome or aura surrounds the figure, suggesting isolation and protection. Single golden thread connecting
to active work, suggesting singular concentration.

State 3 - PENDING: Figure in waiting area or rest station, body relaxed but alert. Minimal visual
noise, suggesting reduced activity but maintained readiness. Semi-transparent cyan indicators show
awareness of incoming work, gentle glow suggesting "standby mode".

Transitions shown as flowing paths:
- Working → Focusing: path narrows and focuses (cyan highlighting convergence)
- Focusing → Working: path expands again (golden expansion energy)
- Working → Pending: path descends and dims (cyan fade effect)
- Pending → Working: path rises and brightens (golden activation)

Central hub shows state machine logic diagram with all transition rules visible as geometric graph
with nodes and edges. The figure moves along this graph, showing current position.

Background suggests a control center with multiple workspace zones, each designed for its state.
Monochrome ink with geometric frameworks representing state boundaries.

Include visual indicators of state duration: clock or hourglass symbols showing time in current state.
Semi-transparent cyan progress bars indicating how close to state transition.

Foreground shows state history: breadcrumb trail showing recent state transitions, helpful for
understanding context when states change.

Style: State machine visualization meets human attention management, meditative flow.
