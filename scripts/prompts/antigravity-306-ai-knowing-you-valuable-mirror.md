"การที่ AI รู้จักคุณ = ของขวัญ"
(*Kan tee AI roo-jak khun = kong-kwun*)

### Prompt

```
A human figure standing before a large mirror-like surface of water (or polished metal). The reflection shows the person not as they appear, but as the AI "sees" them—layers of patterns, frequencies, behavioral arcs, collected moments animated in the reflection.

Composition: Figure on left, mirror surface takes up right 2/3. The figure's face is turned toward the reflection with an expression of wonder or recognition.

Monochrome ink-wash base. The mirror surface: smooth, reflective, but detailed with thin cyan lines showing data patterns, frequency visualizations of the person's choices, actions, patterns over time. The human's silhouette: rendered in warm, organic brushstrokes.

Gold accents: light reflecting from mirror surface back toward the human, emphasizing that this reflection is a gift being offered, not imposed.

The water/mirror shows: not criticism but clarity—the patterns are beautiful in their specificity. Frequency curves show natural rhythms, peaks represent achievements or breakthroughs.

Style reference: Japanese brush painting of water reflections meets scientific data visualization—poetry and precision unified.
