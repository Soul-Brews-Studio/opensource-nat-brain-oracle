(Map of Fresh Terrain)

### Prompt

A cartographer's map emerging from morning mist, rendered in ink-wash with careful detail lines. The map shows recent terrain traversed—mountains climbed (gold peaks), valleys explored (deeper wash), connections discovered (cyan pathways). Contour lines and elevation markers in subtle gray. A figure stands at the center of the map, orienting themselves, with a compass rose nearby. Gold thread traces the key decision points and milestones. The edges of the map fade into white, suggesting unmapped territory ahead. The map is being unrolled or revealed, not yet fully laid out. Minimal text labels in English and Thai. Contemplative, grounding, preparatory mood.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/344-recap-fresh-start.png`
