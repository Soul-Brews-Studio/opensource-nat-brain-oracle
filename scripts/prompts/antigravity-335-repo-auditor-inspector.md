*Repo Auditor - Inspection Equation*

### Prompt

A meticulous figure examining stacked boxes or file containers of varying sizes, rendered in precise ink-wash with measurement instruments. The auditor holds a scale, calculator, or weight balance, carefully evaluating each container's heft. Cyan light traces measurements and comparisons, connecting containers with numbered analysis. Gold accents mark containers that pass inspection or exceed thresholds. Some containers glow with gold (healthy size), others dim with concern (oversized or concerning). The workbench shows ledgers, charts, and mathematical notations in subtle wash tones. The figure wears examining glasses or has an intensely focused expression. Behind the auditor, organized shelving shows containers previously assessed, graded, or categorized. The composition moves from left (unknown/uninspected) to right (analyzed/categorized). Analytical, careful, methodical, precise.
