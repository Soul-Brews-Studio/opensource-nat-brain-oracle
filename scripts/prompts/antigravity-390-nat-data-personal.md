### Title in English
nat-data-personal - Personal Data Oracle

### Thai Text
โอรัคเคิลข้อมูลส่วนตัว
(Orakul Khomul Suantu)
"The Personal Data Oracle"

### Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash portrait of a central spherical form (oracle) containing layered transparent information fragments - text, dates, memories rendered as white paper fragments visible within dark sphere. The sphere pulses with cyan energy radiating outward in organic wave patterns. Gold threads connect outward from the core to surrounding node points representing different data categories or memory clusters. Around the sphere, arranged in organic constellation pattern, smaller nodes float in space - each representing a data point or life moment. These nodes connected back to core with thin gold filaments showing relationship and linkage. Thai script floats in various orientations around the composition in Prompt font - timestamps, categories, emotional resonance indicators. The overall effect suggests a living memory archive - a place where personal history is preserved, indexed, and constantly conversational. Dry-brush texture on edges suggesting passing of time and accumulation of moments. Ethereal quality despite information density. 16:9 landscape with oracle sphere centered, surrounding constellation spreading outward into soft fading white space.
