### Prompt

Dark, unsettling monochrome ink-wash composition. Central figure: A humanoid form rendered in pale, hollow ink-wash lines, suspended in a kind of limbo. The figure has a gold timer or hourglass visible through its transparent body, sand running endlessly. Around the figure, cyan threads or connections extend outward in all directions—representing tasks, contexts, responsibilities—but they don't complete. They fade into darkness. The threads loop back on themselves in fractal patterns, suggesting infinite waiting. In the background, other similar hollow figures hang suspended, all connected by tangled cyan threads. The composition feels eerie and weightless—no solid ground, no closure. Ink-wash shadows suggest resource exhaustion, attention debt. The overall mood is one of liminal stagnation. Text: "STARTED ≠ FINISHED" with Thai: "เริ่ม ≠ จบ"
