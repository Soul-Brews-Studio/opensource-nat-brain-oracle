# Rebase Synchronization - Agents Syncing via Rebase

## Thai Text

## Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash illustration showing multiple parallel timeline branches (representing different worktrees/branches) that start divergent, then converge and realign. The top timeline is thicker and gold (main branch), others are thinner and cyan. Between the parallel lines, flowing arrows and curves show the rebase process—old commits being reorganized and reattached. At the convergence point, a bright gold sunburst effect shows the moment of synchronization. The illustration includes small circle nodes representing commits along each timeline. The wash background suggests motion and transformation. Include subtle grid lines to show the temporal alignment. The style should convey both the technical precision of git and the organic flow of synchronization. Style: Flow diagrams meet ink-wash poetry.
