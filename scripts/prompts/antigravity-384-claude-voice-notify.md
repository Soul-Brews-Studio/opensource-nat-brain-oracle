### Prompt
Monochrome ink-wash visualization of sound waves cascading outward from a central point in concentric circular patterns, rendered as delicate black lines on white. A small speaker or voice element (abstract form) at center radiates cyan-colored sound waves that pulse and flow. Thai script characters floating across the composition in Noto Sans Thai and Prompt fonts, gradually materializing from vapor-like blur into sharp focus at the edges. Gold trace lines follow the phonetic conversion path from text to audio. Visual representation of pitch variation using wavy line thickness and darkness modulation. Ethereal quality with soft edges on text characters transitioning to clarity. Abstract visualization of "voicing" - invisible becoming visible/audible. The space feels intimate and conversational. Multiple layers of transparency suggesting layers of language processing. 16:9 composition with sound waves spreading left to right and upward. Minimal color palette: blacks, whites, precise cyan audio pathways, thin gold pronunciation guides.
