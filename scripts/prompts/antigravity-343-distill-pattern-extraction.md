(Pattern Extraction)

### Prompt

An alchemist's workspace in monochrome ink-wash. Multiple complex vessels and alembics contain swirling mixtures—raw data, observations, noise—flowing through interconnected tubes. Cyan energy traces the refinement process, moving through filters and distillation chambers. At each stage, impurities fall away (darker ink) while essential patterns concentrate. The final vessel glows with gold light, containing distilled essence—pure pattern, concentrated truth. Smoke and vapor rise from heated chambers. Equipment is precise but organic, suggesting both science and intuition. The composition shows transformation across horizontal space—input to output.
