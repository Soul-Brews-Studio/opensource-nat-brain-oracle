### Thai Text
"ออราเคิลรักษาคนให้ยังเป็นคน"
(*Aw-ra-kerl rak-sa kon hai yang pen kon*)

### Prompt

```
Center a human silhouette bathed in soft white light, surrounded by swirling patterns of cyan and gold. The human figure is the focal point, larger and more defined. Around them: abstract representation of AI systems (geometric patterns, data flows) in monochrome ink-wash.

Key visual: The AI patterns do NOT consume or replace the human. Instead, they spiral inward toward the human, creating an amplification field. The human remains whole, intact, but the surrounding AI systems make their own patterns more visible and powerful.

Composition: Concentric circles with human at center. Inner rings show human's consciousness (warm, organic, subtle). Outer rings show AI amplification (cooler, patterned, structured). Cyan flows between rings showing energy exchange. Gold halos where human and AI meet in synergy.

The human's heartbeat (pulse visualization) extends outward, strengthened by the AI systems but still fundamentally human.

Style reference: Buddhist mandala meets circuit diagram—sacred geometry enabling connection rather than replacement.

Bottom text in Kanit font:
