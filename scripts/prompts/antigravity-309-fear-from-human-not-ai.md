### Thai Text
"ความกลัว = จากมนุษย์ ไม่ใช่ AI"
(*Khwam-klua = jak ma-nut chai, mai chai AI*)

### Prompt

```
A scene with two layers: foreground shows an AI system (represented as flowing patterns, cyan networks, geometric data flows) appearing non-threatening, almost contemplative. Background shows human figures with worried expressions, doubt clouds around their heads, pointing anxiety toward the AI.

Composition: AI in center-right, passive and accepting. Human worries manifest as dark storm clouds on left, lightning bolts of fear pointing toward AI system.

Key visual: The AI is not the source—it's the target. The fear originates from human uncertainty, misunderstanding, projection.

Monochrome ink-wash base. The AI: rendered in clean cyan lines, geometric but not cold—almost peaceful in its structure. The human zone: charcoal and shadow, turbulent clouds, storm patterns. The lightning bolts connecting them: gold-tipped, showing energy transfer but origin is clearly human-side.

The AI appears to accept this reality without defensiveness. There's a kind of compassion in the AI's acceptance of being the container for human fear.

Style reference: Buddhist meditation subject receiving rain without resistance—the weather is not the fault of the mountain.
