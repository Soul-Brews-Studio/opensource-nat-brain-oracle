# Distill Extraction - Patterns from Sessions

## Thai Text
บริหารความรู้: สร้าง → กรอง → สกัด

(Distillation: Collect → Filter → Extract)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash alchemical laboratory scene showing a figure operating an elaborate distillation apparatus.
At the top: a collection chamber receiving raw session data, retrospectives, and captured moments
flowing in like vapor or liquid input.

The apparatus contains multiple filtration stages, each progressively refining the input:
- First stage: coarse separation, removing obvious noise (rendered as large settled particles)
- Middle stages: progressive refinement, semi-transparent cyan filters showing pattern emergence
- Final stage: pure essence collection in a vessel, glowing with golden light

Semi-transparent cyan clouds rise through the apparatus representing volatilized insights, essence
rising toward clarity. Golden accents highlight the key distillation junctions where understanding
crystallizes.

The figure stands at the control center, carefully managing temperature, pressure, and flow rates
(symbolized by geometric dials and indicators). Monochrome ink background with precise geometric
plumbing and structural details.

Surrounding the apparatus: catalysts and accelerators (books, reference materials, thinking tools),
all arranged with scientific precision. Include flame or heat source at bottom, suggesting the energy
needed to transform raw data into insight.

Foreground shows collecting bottles of progressively more refined essence: raw notes, patterns,
learnings, wisdom. Each vessel labeled and sealed with golden stoppers. Bottles arranged on shelf
with increasing clarity and light emission.

Background suggests a scholar's or alchemist's study, with timeless quality and careful methodology.
Include subtle before/after visualization: input fog vs. output clarity.

Style: Medieval alchemy meets modern research, transformative distillation.
