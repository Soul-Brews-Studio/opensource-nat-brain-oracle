# Plugin Architecture Layers

## Thai Text
สถาปัตยกรรม Plugin: ชั้น ซ้อน ตั้งใจ

(Plugin Architecture: Intentional Layering)

## Prompt
```
Vertical cross-section diagram showing plugin architecture as nested layers, like tree rings
or geological strata. Monochrome ink with golden accents marking layer boundaries and
connection points.

FIVE LAYERS from bottom to top:

LAYER 1 (Foundation - bottom): Solid black horizontal band representing core system.
Golden geometric border. Small text: "CORE / KERNEL"

LAYER 2 (Plugin Interface): Ink wash suggesting semi-transparent access boundary. Cyan
circles mark API entry points. Golden lines show authenticated access paths.

LAYER 3 (Plugin Space): Large open area with multiple plugin blocks shown as rounded
rectangles with distinct ink hatching patterns (each plugin has unique visual pattern).
Plugins shown slightly offset/floating to suggest they are separate modules.
Golden connectors link plugins to the interface layer above and below.

LAYER 4 (Plugin Context): Thin layer showing shared state, context, and configuration.
Cyan webs connect all plugins to this layer. Golden lines show data flow paths.

LAYER 5 (Integration Shield - top): Protective boundary shown as geometric pattern.
Cyan checkmarks show validation points. Golden gates represent entry/exit controls.

RIGHT SIDE: Small icons showing different plugin types (hook, command, adapter, observer).
Each with distinctive visual marker.

CONNECTIONS: Fine lines showing plugin-to-plugin communication across layers.
Data flows represented as golden threads with directional arrows.

Style: Architectural blueprint meets ink painting. Clean geometry with organic plugin shapes.
Abundant negative space. Monochrome with accent colors marking critical paths.
