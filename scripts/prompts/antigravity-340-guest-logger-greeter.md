*Guest Logger - Greeter & Recorder*

### Prompt

A welcoming figure standing at a threshold or gateway, arms open in greeting, rendered in warm ink-wash. Behind the greeter stands a grand registry or ledger, glowing with gold light—all visitors logged and recorded. As new arrivals approach (suggested by approaching cyan-outlined figures in the distance), the greeter extends a hand in warm welcome. A quill or pen hovers ready to record each visitor's arrival, purpose, and contribution. Gold marks recorded entries stacked in the registry. Cyan light traces the flow of visitors through the gateway—an orderly process of acknowledgment and documentation. The threshold is clearly marked with symbolic boundaries or decorative elements. The greeter's expression is open, generous, and attentive—making each visitor feel seen and valued. The background shows the continuous flow of activity—guests arriving, being recorded, moving forward. Warm, inclusive, attentive, ceremonial.
