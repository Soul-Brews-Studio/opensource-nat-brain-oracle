# Executor Pipeline - Running Commands

## Thai Text
ผู้บริหารการทำงาน: ประเมิน → ดำเนิน → ผลลัพธ์

(Executor: Assess → Execute → Output)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash pipeline diagram showing commands flowing through sequential stages like an assembly line.
Multiple parallel channels represent concurrent task execution, each channel containing:

- Input valve (issue/request entry point, marked with geometric inlet symbol)
- Processing chamber (central working area with swirling motion lines)
- Output port (results flowing outward, marked with geometric outlet symbol)

The executor figure stands at the control center, orchestrating multiple parallel pipelines simultaneously.
Semi-transparent cyan pressure gauges on each channel indicate completion status and flow rate.

Golden accents trace the control signals flowing from central hub to each channel, forming a radial
distribution pattern. Include progress indicators: filled circles for complete tasks, empty for pending,
halfway-filled for in-progress.

Background shows layered horizontal bands representing different priority levels or parallel execution tiers.
Monochrome ink with geometric piping network. Include subtle data flow indicators (small arrows, particles)
moving through channels with different velocities.

Foreground shows result containers collecting outputs, with golden bands sealing completed work.
Include timestamp markers on output containers.

Style: Industrial automation diagram meets minimalist ink painting.
