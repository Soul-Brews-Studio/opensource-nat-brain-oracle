ห้องเก็บสมบัติความรู้
(Hong Kep Sombat Khomruu)
"The Knowledge Treasury Chamber"

### Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash illustration of nested vaults or chambers, each layer slightly receding into depth. Heavy black obsidian-like borders frame rectangular and circular compartments. Pages or scrolls visible inside chambers, rendered as white rectangles with fine black text (too small to read, suggesting information density). Cyan threads or links interconnecting knowledge nodes between chambers - some links direct, others curved and flowing. Gold markers highlight important connections or decision points where knowledge converges. A magnifying glass or focal point draws a bright gold circle around one central piece of knowledge in the innermost chamber. Surrounding haze created through ink-wash diffusion suggests vast knowledge quantity beyond immediate view. Some pages appear to float or move suggesting dynamic nature. Thai text labels (Noto Sans Thai) marking vault sections and categories. Dry brush texture suggests stone or ancient material quality. 16:9 composition with vaults arranged left to right showing progressive expansion outward.

**Expected Output**: PNG 1920x1080, saved as `results/388-obsidian-vault.png`
