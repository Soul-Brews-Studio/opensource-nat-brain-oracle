# Agent Autonomy Spectrum - From Controlled to Autonomous

## Thai Text
สเปคตรัมความเป็นอิสระ | จากควบคุมถึงอิสระอย่างสมบูรณ์

## Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash illustration showing a horizontal spectrum or gradient bar that transitions from left to right (controlled to autonomous). On the left: agents shown in geometric "cages" or grids (representing strict control), rendered in dense line patterns. At the center: agents transitioning with some lines dissolving into wash. On the right: agents rendered in flowing, free forms (representing full autonomy), with minimal line constraints and organic shapes. Each stage shows a progressive agent figure (from rigid geometric to flowing abstract). Gold and cyan gradients flow along the spectrum bar. Small icons or symbols represent different levels of autonomy (chains, locks, partial gates, open doors, wings). The background uses wash to show the spectrum as a continuous transformation rather than discrete steps. Include subtle labeling at each major stage. Style: Spectrum analysis meets liberation narrative.
