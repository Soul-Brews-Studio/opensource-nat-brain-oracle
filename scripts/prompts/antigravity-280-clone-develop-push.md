# Clone-Develop-Push Flow

## Thai Text
การไหล: Clone → พัฒนา → Push

(Flow: Clone → Develop → Push)

## Prompt
```
Horizontal three-act flowchart showing the clone-develop-push workflow in monochrome ink
with golden orchestration lines and cyan activation points. Suggests water flowing through
a landscape transforming it.

ACT 1: CLONE (left third)
Remote repository shown as a mountain peak or large stone formation in ink wash.
Golden light from upper left illuminates it. Small text "Remote/Upstream"

Clone action shown as:
- Golden beam/light projecting downward from peak to plain below
- Ink wash forms a mirror image growing on the ground (the clone)
- Growing image shows the codebase crystallizing, tree structure branching downward
- Cyan nodes mark key files/structure elements appearing
- Motion lines show rapid duplication/transfer happening

Ground level shows: "Local worktree / ghq directory" in fine text

ACT 2: DEVELOP (center third)
The cloned repository shown as living, growing codebase. Rendered as fine-lined network
of files and directories in concentric spreading circles, like ripples.

Development activities shown as:
- Hands (minimalist ink silhouette) engaging with code (golden highlight points)
- Branching lines extending from main structure (feature branches)
- Cyan pulses showing repeated edit-test cycles
- Commits shown as nodes being added to the graph, connected by golden links
- Time markers (clock symbols in small ink) showing duration

The codebase visibly transforms: starts ordered and regular, becomes more complex and
organic as features accumulate, then consolidates again as main branch solidifies.

Surrounding elements:
- Git object database shown as accumulating golden spheres (growing .git)
- Context layers shown in concentric rings (code, tests, docs, config)

ACT 3: PUSH (right third)
Local worktree transforms back into upward-flowing beam of golden light, projecting
back up toward the remote mountain peak.

Push action shown as:
- Reverse of clone action: code flowing upward as golden current
- Cyan nodes represent diff hunks being transmitted
- Remote peak receiving the incoming flow, transforming its appearance slightly
  (showing impact of the contribution)
- New state established at remote, radiating outward in golden ripples
- Multiple peaks potentially receiving (for distributed team)

Return connection: Thin feedback line from remote back to local showing sync state

OVERALL VISUAL FLOW:
Gentle spiral or wave pattern connecting all three acts, suggesting continuous cycle.
Timestamps mark beginning, middle, and end. Commit hashes shown in tiny text along push flow.

SUPPORTING ELEMENTS:
- Top: Git workflow phases labeled (fetch → merge base, develop locally, push)
- Bottom: Data structures shown (commits, trees, blobs) in geometric icon form
- Left margin: Configuration hints (origin, branch names)
- Right margin: Typical error states shown faded/blocked (permission denied, merge conflict)

STYLE: Water flow visualization meets git workflow diagram. Heavy ink wash for natural
motion, golden/cyan for energy transfer and technical precision. Monochrome base allowing
color accents to guide the eye through workflow sequence.
