### Prompt

A sentinel figure standing alert with an elaborate shield or scanning apparatus, rendered in ink-wash detail. The shield emanates cyan light in concentric circles—waves of scanning energy moving outward, analyzing and detecting threats. Suspicious elements are caught and outlined in gold—highlighting detected anomalies. Shadowy threats or suspicious patterns approach from the darkness at the edges, but are intercepted by the cyan scanning waves before reaching the center. The guardian figure is calm but vigilant, armor detailed but not heavy. Around the shield, a corona of protective energy pulses. The background fades from light (protected zone) to dark (external threats) creating depth and danger. Gold marks successful detections and blocked threats. The figure's stance is confident and reassuring—watchful without being paranoid. Alert, protective, perceptive, steady.
