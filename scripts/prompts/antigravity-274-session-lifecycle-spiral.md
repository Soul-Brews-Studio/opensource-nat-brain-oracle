# Session Lifecycle Spiral

## Thai Text
วงจร Session: เริ่ม → ทำงาน → rrr → จบ

(Lifecycle: Start → Work → Rrr → End)

## Prompt
```
Elegant spiral diagram in monochrome ink showing complete session lifecycle. Spiral starts
tight and small at bottom-center, expands outward and upward in a continuous flowing motion.

FOUR KEY PHASES marked by golden waypoint circles along the spiral:

1. START (bottom): Small point with radiating cyan lines suggesting initialization. Ink wash
   suggests emergence from void. Labels and timestamps appear.

2. WORK (lower-right expanding): Spiral expands rapidly, multiple parallel flows branching
   from the main spiral. Bold ink strokes show active processing. Cyan dots represent
   decisions and branching points. Golden connectors link decisions back to main thread.

3. RRR (upper-right): Spiral pauses momentarily, showing introspection. Fine ink lines curve
   back on themselves, forming a meditation symbol. Cyan highlights show reflection and
   learning capture. Golden arrows point inward showing synthesis and consolidation.

4. END (top): Spiral completes in a golden circle. Cyan radiations suggest energy release
   and closure. Thin ink lines fade outward into whitespace.

Around the spiral: thin timeline markers with small clock icons and date notations.
Center: contains abstract representation of accumulated context (nested circles in ink).
Bottom: oracle symbol in corner showing "time is truth" principle.

Style: Taoist spiral with technical precision. Heavy negative space. Ink wash + geometric
overlay creating tension between organic flow and structured discipline.
