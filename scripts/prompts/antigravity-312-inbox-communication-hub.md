### Thai Text
**หลายความพูดไหลมา**
(Messages Flowing In)

### Prompt

A hub or nexus point where multiple pathways converge, rendered in ink-wash architecture style. Cyan light streams flow inward from all directions—different thicknesses, different intensities, each representing a distinct message or communication thread. The convergence point glows with gold accents, showing reception and collection. The messages take visible form—words, symbols, voice bubbles in Thai and English script floating within the cyan streams. Some messages are sharp and focused, others are diffuse and complex. The center has a gathering pool or vessel where all streams pool together. The background shows the sources of these streams—distant voices, other minds, external world. The mood is receptive, alive, connected. There's gentle chaos in the convergence but order in the pooling. Open, listening, gathered.
