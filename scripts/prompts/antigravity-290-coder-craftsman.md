# Coder Craftsman - Writing Quality Code

## Thai Text
ช่างโค้ด: ออกแบบ → เขียน → เรียบเรียง

(Code Craftsman: Design → Write → Polish)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash portrait of a craftsperson at a workbench surrounded by tools and materials. The figure
is positioned mid-creation, with code or abstract algorithmic patterns flowing from hands like
luminous threads.

The workbench contains: design sketches, architectural blueprints, quality standards checklist,
all rendered in monochrome ink with precise geometric precision. Tools arranged methodically include
linters, formatters, test frameworks (symbolized as precise cutting/measuring instruments).

Code flows upward from the figure's workspace as glowing cyan threads that spiral and interweave,
forming increasingly complex patterns. Golden accents highlight moments of creative breakthrough or
perfect solutions.

Background shows a layered guild hall or atelier space with hierarchical skill levels represented
in vertical bands - apprentice work at bottom (rougher), journeyman in middle, master work at top
(perfectly refined). The figure occupies the master tier.

Include subtle symbols: balanced scales (quality vs speed), unfurling scroll (documentation),
sealed letters (delivered code). Monochrome ink base with geometric framework representing
code structure and design patterns.

Semi-transparent cyan circles highlight moments of flow state or perfect implementation.

Style: Traditional craftsperson + digital virtuosity, zen focus.
