### Prompt

A craftsperson's workshop in monochrome ink-wash, tables laden with papers in various states of completion. Rough sketches evolve into refined drafts, drafts become polished articles. Cyan light traces the transformation journey—beginning as chaotic brainstorm at the left, becoming increasingly structured and clear toward the right. Gold accents mark moments of creative breakthrough and completion. Scattered materials—crossed-out lines, margin notes, coffee cups—suggest active iterative work. A figure stands at the center workbench, hand raised mid-gesture, engaged in creative refinement. Tools hang on walls—pens, scissors, organizers. The composition moves left-to-right showing the journey from raw thought to finished creation. The mood is focused, purposeful, craft-oriented. There's beauty in the mess and process. Productive, alive, transformative.
