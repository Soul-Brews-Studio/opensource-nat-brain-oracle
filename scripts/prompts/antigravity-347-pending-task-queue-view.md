(Queue of Waiting)

### Prompt

Figures standing in a patient line, rendered in ink-wash minimalism. Each figure is distinct but similar, wearing slightly different garments or postures suggesting varied tasks. Cyan light connects them in sequence, showing order and flow. Gold markers highlight the front of the queue (what's next) and time progression. The line curves gently into space, suggesting continuation beyond the frame. Above each figure, subtle priority indicators or task labels in Thai script. The background is calm, cool wash tones suggesting organized waiting. A figure at the front is already moving—showing the queue's function. Peaceful but purposeful, organized, patient.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/347-pending-task-queue.png`
