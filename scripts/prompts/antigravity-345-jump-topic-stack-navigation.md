### Prompt

Parkour silhouettes leaping between floating platforms, each representing a different context or topic. Ink-wash rendering with geometric platform shapes. Cyan light trails behind the figure as they move mid-jump, showing trajectory and momentum. Gold outlines mark landing zones. Platforms are at varying heights and distances, suggesting the cognitive leap required. Below the platforms, a darker void or ocean in wash tones. The figure is captured mid-motion, dynamic and confident. Stacked visually but spatially separated—suggesting navigation through layers. Multiple possible paths visible. High energy, kinetic, acrobatic.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/345-jump-topic-navigation.png`
