### Thai Text
**แสงโฟกัสนั่งศูนย์**
(Single Beam of Focus)

### Prompt

A perfect cone or beam of light—gold and cyan merged into white intensity—descending from above in a dark landscape. The beam illuminates a single object or space in perfect clarity while everything beyond the beam dissolves into darkness. Inside the beam, details are sharp and crisp. Outside, the world becomes increasingly unclear. A figure stands at the center of the beam, hands raised toward the light, fully immersed. The beam has clear boundaries—defining the zone of focus. The source of the beam (above) is bright but not shown directly. The mood is meditative, intense, consecrated. There's both relief and intensity in the focused state. The composition emphasizes verticality and centrality. No distractions visible. Clarity, purpose, presence in single focus.
