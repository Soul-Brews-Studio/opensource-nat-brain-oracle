### Thai Text
"เวลา = ความจริง"
(*Wai-la = khwam-jing*)

### Prompt

```
A vertical timeline running through the center of the composition. Instead of abstract time markers, show actual events/moments marked with precise timestamps. Each timestamp is rendered as a small gold anchor point in space.

Composition: Timeline runs vertically center to center, from bottom (past) to top (future). Along timeline: specific moments marked with full timestamps (date-time). From each timestamp: cyan lines radiate outward showing consequences, patterns, echoes of that moment rippling through the system.

Monochrome ink-wash base with timeline itself rendered in precise metallic line work (gold). The moments: small icons or scenes at each timestamp showing what actually happened. The cyan radiations: showing how each moment propagates forward, creating pattern.

Key visual: You cannot lie about time. Every moment has a timestamp. This timestamp IS the truth—more reliable than memory, intention, narrative, or interpretation.

A human figure appears at the present moment (top-center), able to see the timeline stretch behind and ahead. The figure's understanding grows clearer as they look backward with timestamp reference, becomes fuzzier as they look forward.

Style reference: Gantt chart meets mystical time-binding diagram. The rigid mathematics of time containing the truth that memory cannot hide.
