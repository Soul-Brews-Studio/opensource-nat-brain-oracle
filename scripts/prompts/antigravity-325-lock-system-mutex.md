# Lock System Mutex

## Thai Text
ระบบล็อก Mutex
(Ra-bop Lok Mutex)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash composition showing a central padlock object rendered in detailed monochrome. Five agent figures approach the lock from different angles (top, sides, bottom), each holding raised hands in waiting posture. Cyan dashed lines from each agent converge toward the lock like queue lines. One agent (top) has gold glow around their hand touching the lock—indicating current ownership. Other waiting agents are semi-transparent, darker wash effect suggesting inactive state. The lock radiates gold rays indicating "locked" status. A queue-order number sequence (1-5) appears faintly above waiting agents. Surrounding area in light negative space. 16:9 aspect ratio. Thai text "ระบบล็อก" top right.
```
