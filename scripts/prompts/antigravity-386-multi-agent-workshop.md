### Prompt
An overhead view (bird's eye perspective) rendered in monochrome ink-wash showing multiple workstations or nodes arranged in organic network formation. Each node is a small circle or point rendered in dark blacks with subtle gray gradients. Cyan connecting lines flow between nodes in curved pathways, showing communication and collaboration patterns. Thick and thin line weights suggest message flow intensity. Gold junction points highlight synchronization moments or completed handoffs between agents. The entire network appears to be in motion - flowing curves suggest active dialogue. Vertical white space dominates the composition while black elements create structure. Center area shows a teaching nexus with radiating pathways. Table surfaces shown as horizontal wash lines. Scattered papers or notes on surfaces rendered as small text fragments in Thai fonts (Prompt, Kanit). A few human figures rendered as simple line drawings positioned throughout, indicating human participants in the workshop. 16:9 landscape format emphasizing distributed network spread horizontally.
