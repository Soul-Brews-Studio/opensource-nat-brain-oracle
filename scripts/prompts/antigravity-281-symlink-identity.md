# Symlink Identity Web

## Thai Text
เว็บอัตลักษณ์ Symlink: เชื่อมโยง ไม่ทำซ้ำ

(Identity Web: Link, Don't Duplicate)

## Prompt
```
Complex network diagram showing symlinks as connective tissue between projects.
Monochrome ink with golden primary paths and cyan secondary connections. Suggests
neural network or spider web structure.

NETWORK NODES (scattered across canvas):
Multiple file/directory icons rendered as nested boxes in ink. Each node represents a
project or symbolic location. Nodes placed at varying distances suggesting different
project categories (active, learning, incubation, archived).

Physical placement creates natural groupings:
- Cluster upper-left: "Active Projects"
- Cluster upper-right: "Learning Projects"
- Cluster bottom: "Incubation Projects"
- Single points scattered: "Referenced Assets"

SYMLINK CONNECTIONS (primary narrative):
Golden lines connecting nodes, marked with small arrow symbols showing direction of
symlink relationship. Lines NOT rendered as straight paths, but as gentle curves
(organic flow) occasionally interrupted by fine geometric nodes (representing symlink
inodes in filesystem hierarchy).

Each golden symlink shows:
- STARTING POINT: Solid black circle (source directory)
- PATH LINE: Golden curved line with small "→" markers
- ENDPOINT: Larger hollow circle showing the symbolic destination
- TEXT LABEL: Fine text along the line (relative path like "../../projects/foo")

Three types of symlinks visually differentiated:
1. Hard symlinks (thick golden lines): Core shared resources
2. Soft symlinks (thinner golden lines): Convenience references
3. Alias symlinks (dashed golden lines): Shortcuts/abstractions

CONTEXT FLOWS (secondary):
Thin cyan lines show data/context flowing through symlink network:
- Code changes radiating outward from source project
- Configuration inheritance flowing along cyan threads
- Dependency notifications pulsing along connections

DETAIL VIEWS (insets):
- Upper-left inset: Magnified filesystem hierarchy showing how symlinks appear in dir tree
  (file icons with arrow overlay showing "symbolic" nature)
- Lower-right inset: Inode mapping diagram showing physical disk location vs symbolic path

SURROUNDING INFRASTRUCTURE:
- Central node labeled "ghq root" or "workspace root" with radial symmetry
- Secondary infrastructure nodes showing shared systems (git, cache, config)
- Fence/barrier symbols around clusters suggesting project boundaries

EFFICIENCY INDICATORS:
- Golden highlights on frequently accessed symlinks (showing "hot paths")
- Faded connections on inactive/archived symlinks
- Small counters showing "3 projects share this asset" etc.

INTEGRITY MARKERS:
- Small check marks (cyan) at endpoints showing "linked properly"
- Warning symbols (golden-red) on broken links or circular references
- Timestamp annotations showing "last verified: XX minutes ago"

BOTTOM LEGEND:
Small key showing:
  ══━→ Hard symlink (core resource)
  ───→ Soft symlink (convenience)
  ╌╌╌→ Alias symlink (abstraction)

Oracle principle note: "The web reflects, not duplicates" showing symlink philosophy

STYLE: Neural network visualization meets filesystem diagram. Golden primary network
suggests intentional design, cyan flowing threads suggest natural emergence. Monochrome
base with geometric precision on nodes, organic curves on connections. Whitespace used
to show separation between clusters while maintaining visual unity of overall web.
