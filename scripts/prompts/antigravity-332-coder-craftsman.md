### Prompt

An artisan seated at a wooden workbench in monochrome ink-wash, fingers moving deftly, weaving threads of code like a loom master. The workbench is organized—tools arranged with precision: brushes, styluses, crystalline code structures. Beneath the weaver's hands, threads of cyan light flow and intertwine, forming intricate patterns that glow with inner logic. Gold accents mark completed structures and elegant solutions emerging from the work. The background shows partially woven tapestries—previous works in progress or completed projects—in varied wash tones. Light falls across the workspace suggesting concentration and care. Thread spools and half-finished compositions surround the figure. Each line the craftsman makes is deliberate, building complexity from simple threads. The mood is meditative but purposeful—this is quality work, not speed. Detailed, intentional, masterful.
