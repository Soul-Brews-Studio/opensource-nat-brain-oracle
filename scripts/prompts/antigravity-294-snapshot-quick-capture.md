# Snapshot - Quick Knowledge Capture

## Thai Text
ภาพรวม: จับ → ปักหมุด → เก็บรักษา

(Snapshot: Capture → Pin → Preserve)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash illustration of a figure with hands cupped around a glowing moment or burst of light,
capturing ephemeral insights before they dissolve. The captured moment suspended in semi-transparent
cyan light, frozen mid-dissolution.

The figure stands at the center, with multiple snapshot moments orbiting around at different distances
and opacity levels - representing varying capture times and importance levels. The brightest, most
recent snapshot directly in hands, older snapshots fading as they move outward in orbital pattern.

Each snapshot contains visual symbolic content: thought bubbles, key concepts, breakthrough moments
rendered in precise geometric form, contrasting with the fluid ink-wash background.

Semi-transparent golden frames mark the boundaries of captured moments, like instant photographs or
pinned specimens under glass. Include subtle timestamp indicators on each capture.

Background shows a flowing stream or river of ideas and moments - some captured, others flowing past
unused. The figure selectively intercepts moments of value, pulling them from the stream into preserved state.

Include visual metaphor: fishing net or collection basket gradually filling with gleaming insights,
each one sealed with a golden closure.

Foreground shows preserved moments in labeled containers or vessels, ready for later retrieval and study.
Include filing symbols, bookmark markers, reference tags.

Style: Ephemeral moment preservation meets mindful observation, split-second clarity.
