# Archiver Pattern - Finding & Preserving

## Thai Text
ผู้เก็บรักษา: ค้นหา → เก็บ → หน่วยเก็บ

(Archivist: Find → Collect → Archive)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash composition showing a figure with dowsing rods or search implements, standing over layers
of documents/files arranged in geological strata. Top layer represents "Active", middle layers show
"Aging" and "Dormant", bottom layer shows "Archive Vault".

The figure moves downward through the layers, with paths traced in golden lines showing items being
sorted and moved deeper into storage. Semi-transparent cyan indicators mark items found as candidates
for archiving - glowing brighter as they sink into lower layers.

Background suggests a library or repository with tall shelves fading into mist. Monochrome ink with
geometric honeycomb patterns representing organized storage structure.

Include subtle animation concept: items gradually descend through layers like sedimentary deposits.
Include timestamp markers on items (years, dates) getting older as they move down.

Foreground shows sealed boxes or containers with golden bands, suggesting preservation and time-locking.
