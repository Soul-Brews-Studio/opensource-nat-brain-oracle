### Prompt

A botanical garden rendered in ink-wash where experimental plants and proofs-of-concept grow from soil. Each plant is unique—some climbing vines, some flowering, some still sprouting. Cyan light traces nutrient flows from roots upward, showing growth and vitality. Gold accents mark plants at peak maturity or exceptional promise. Some plants are hybrid—unusual combinations of forms, suggesting cross-pollination of ideas. Gardener figures tend different areas with quiet attention. The soil is rich and detailed. The garden has defined sections but organic arrangement. Beyond the garden, both walls and open sky visible. The mood is nurturing, hopeful, patient—experiments need time. Natural growth cycles visible. Alive, generative, experimental.
