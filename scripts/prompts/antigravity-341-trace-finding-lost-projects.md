**ค้นหาโครงการที่ว่างเว้น**
(Finding Lost Projects)

### Prompt

An archaeological excavation site depicted in ink-wash style. Layers of earth reveal buried artifacts—old commit hashes, forgotten branch names, and dormant project folders emerging from darkness. Cyan light traces through the sediment like root systems, illuminating pathways between past and present. A single figure with a lantern descends into layers, their light revealing connections and timelines. Gold outlines mark significant discoveries—the moments when lost history becomes visible again. Dust particles suspended in air catch cyan light. The composition moves downward, suggesting deep excavation through time. Minimal, poetic, archaeological reverence.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/341-trace-finding-lost-projects.png`
