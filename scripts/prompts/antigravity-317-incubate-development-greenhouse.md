(Greenhouse Nurturing Growth)

### Prompt

A glass-roofed greenhouse rendered in ink-wash where code repositories and development projects sprout and flourish. The glass allows external light in while maintaining controlled conditions. Multiple shelves and hanging systems contain growing projects at different stages. Cyan light traces resources and energy flowing into the space—nutrients, water, care. Gold accents highlight projects approaching readiness for transplanting to production. Temperature and humidity indicators suggest careful environmental control. A developer figure tends seedlings and tends growing projects. The greenhouse is warm, humid, alive with potential. Some projects show vigorous growth, others are carefully tended still-delicate specimens. Tools and supplies organized nearby. The composition emphasizes the containment and control needed for development work. The mood is nurturing, hopeful, protective. Growth under intention.
