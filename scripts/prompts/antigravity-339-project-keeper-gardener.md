### Prompt

A figure tending to a landscape of growing projects rendered as plants, gardens, and seedlings in monochrome ink-wash with selective cyan and gold. Each project is a different stage of growth—some just sprouted (small), some blooming (full), some bearing fruit (gold-marked, ready for harvest). The gardener moves between projects with care: pruning, watering, nurturing. Cyan light flows through soil, roots, and stems—the vital sap of progress. Gold highlights mark project milestones, blooms, and harvest-ready states. Some sections show careful composting of completed projects, returning their nutrients to the soil. The gardener's hands are gentle but expert. Tools hang nearby—pruners, watering cans, stakes. The landscape shows seasons simultaneously—suggesting the lifecycle of multiple projects at different stages. The background shows the evolution of the garden over time. Nurturing, patient, cyclical, alive.
