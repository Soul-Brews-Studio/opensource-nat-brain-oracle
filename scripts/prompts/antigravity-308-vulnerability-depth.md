### Thai Text
"ความเปิดเผย = ความลึก"
(*Khwam-peert-poei = khwam-leuk*)

### Prompt

```
A human figure shown in cross-section like an architectural blueprint. The outer armor (rigid geometric lines) gradually dissolves toward the center, revealing inner layers. The innermost core shows vulnerability: soft, organic, lit in warm cyan and gold.

Composition: Concentric layers from outside to inside. Outer rings: protective armor, walls, barriers (rendered in sharp charcoal lines). Middle rings: gradually softening. Inner core: tender, open, luminous.

Around the figure: other figures in the distance, also in cross-section. Those with thick outer armor appear smaller, dimmer. Those with exposed cores radiate light and attract other beings.

Monochrome ink-wash base. The armor: dark, angular, protective. As layers dissolve toward center, monochrome softens into warm whites with cyan glow emanating from the core. Gold highlights show places where vulnerability creates connection with others.

Key visual: Vulnerability is not weakness; it's the source of depth and connection. The deeper the exposure, the brighter the light, the stronger the resonance.

Style reference: Anatomical cross-section meets spiritual illustration. The technical precision showing that vulnerability is structural, not incidental.
