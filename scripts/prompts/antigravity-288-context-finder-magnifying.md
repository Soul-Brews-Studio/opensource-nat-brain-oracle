# Context Finder - Magnifying Glass Search

## Thai Text

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash illustration centered on a massive magnifying glass held by a figure in the lower portion
of frame. Through the lens, intricate patterns of interconnected nodes, documents, and memory fragments
become visible and sharply defined.

The magnifying glass reveals networks of glowing cyan lines connecting: git logs, issue comments,
retrospectives, learnings, and memory files. Each connection point marked with a small golden dot
or junction.

Outside the lens, the background appears diffuse and unfocused - representing the undifferentiated
chaos of all available information. Inside the lens, clarity and relationship emerge with sharp
geometric clarity.

Semi-transparent overlays show search terms or queries floating around the lens, with some terms
entering the lens and others still searching. Include radiating circles from search focal points,
showing expansion of understanding.

Monochrome ink base with dense geometric patterns outside lens, sparse clean patterns inside.
Golden accents highlight key connections. Include subtle query symbols (@, #, /) around the lens.

Style: Detective investigation meets data visualization, with zen calm precision.
