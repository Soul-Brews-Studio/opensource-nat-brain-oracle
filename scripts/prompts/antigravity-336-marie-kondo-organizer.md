### Prompt

A graceful figure moving through a landscape of scattered objects—files, documents, code blocks, data clusters—all in monochrome ink-wash with flowing movements. The organizer's hands gently touch and sort items into distinct piles and categories, creating order from chaos. Cyan light traces the organizing principle—showing the emerging structure and logic of the arrangement. Gold glow illuminates items that "spark joy" or are deemed essential and valuable. Dismissed items fade into darker wash tones as they're removed from consideration. Behind the organizer, previously organized zones show serene, clean arrangement. The figure moves with respect and gratitude toward even the items being discarded. Shelving or organizational structures emerge in the background. The composition shows the transformation from disorder (left) to order (right). Thoughtful, respectful, clarifying, peaceful.
