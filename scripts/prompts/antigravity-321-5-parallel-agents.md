# 5 Parallel Agents

## Thai Text
เอเจนต์ 5 ตัว ทำงานขนาน
(Agents Ha Tua Tham-ngan Kha-naan)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash monochrome composition showing five parallel vertical lanes. Each lane contains a minimalist figure (circle head, rectangular body) with cyan energy flows (thin lines with small circles) moving horizontally across their workspace. Gold accent lines mark completed checkpoints at regular intervals. The background features faint diagonal hatching suggesting motion and time progression. Each agent's lane is subtly separated by thin gray boundaries. Cyan glow around active work zones, gold markers where tasks complete. 16:9 aspect ratio, clean negative space, emphasizing parallel processing and simultaneous work. Thai text "เอเจนต์ 5 ตัว" in top left, minimal serif font.
```
