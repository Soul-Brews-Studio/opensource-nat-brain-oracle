# Agent Isolation Bubbles - Sandboxed Contexts

## Thai Text
ฟองการแยก | แต่ละแอจเอนต์ในบริบทของตัวเอง

## Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash illustration showing 4-6 transparent spherical bubbles of varying sizes arranged in space. Each bubble contains a distinct geometric agent representation (abstract shapes, flowing lines, or symbolic forms). The bubbles are carefully separated from each other, emphasizing isolation. However, thin cyan connecting lines bridge between the bubbles, showing that while isolated, they can communicate. The interior of each bubble has subtle geometric patterns and shading (different for each) to show distinct context. The background uses wash gradients to create depth. Gold accents mark the connection points between bubbles. The bubbles have semi-transparent wash-style edges that feel organic but precisely positioned. Include fine detail suggesting data flowing across the connection lines. Style: Quantum illustration meets architectural diagram.
