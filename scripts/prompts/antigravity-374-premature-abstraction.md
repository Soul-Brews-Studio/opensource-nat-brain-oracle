### Prompt

Ink-wash perspective drawing viewed from below. A towering, elaborate abstract structure rises upward in gold-tinted lines—elegant, geometrically complex, mathematically beautiful. But at the base, rendered in dark monochrome ink, the foundation is laughably small, unsupported. The structure defies physics visually, swaying precariously. Cyan stress lines and fractures show the strain. Below the structure, a simple concrete rectangular base (shown small compared to the architecture) looks abandoned and insufficient. The actual problem it solves is shown in tiny, simple ink-wash scenes in the foreground—a person needing shelter, a basic need—but the architecture above is so complex it has lost touch with that need. The perspective emphasizes scale: huge complexity above, ignored simplicity below. Text: "COMPLEXITY ≠ SOLUTION" with Thai: "ความซับซ้อน ≠ วิธีแก้"
