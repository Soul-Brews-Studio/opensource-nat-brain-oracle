# Hey Command Bridge - Sending Messages Between Agents

## Thai Text
สะพานข้อความ | การสื่อสารระหว่างแอจเอนต์

## Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash illustration of a bridge (architectural style: simple geometric span with a slight arch) connecting two distant platforms. On each platform stands a stylized agent (geometric forms: towers, pillars, or abstract humanoid shapes). Between them, a flow of message packets (rendered as small geometric shapes: squares, triangles, circles) travels across the bridge in both directions. The message packets glow with cyan color as they traverse. At the bridge's center, messages merge and split (showing the bidirectional nature). The platforms and agents are rendered with precise geometry, while the message flow uses flowing organic curves. Gold accents highlight key communication nodes. The background shows subtle wash layers suggesting the separation between agents (different terrain, different atmospheres). Include faint text or symbols on the message packets suggesting content. Style: Medieval architecture meets digital communication.
