### Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash gallery space with floating cards and prompts suspended at varying heights in a gravity-defiant arrangement. Watercolor diffusion of light grays creating depth and atmosphere. A single figure stands in the center, gazing upward at spinning orbs of cyan energy (representing text/ideas) orbiting overhead. Gold filaments trace the paths of ascending visual concepts, connecting scattered prompts to a central nexus. Time-lapse effect showing multiple exposure of ideas floating away and reforming. Architectural elements (gallery walls, ceiling) fade into abstract horizontal wash lines. Minimal color: mostly blacks, grays, whites with precise cyan energy nodes and thin gold accents highlighting completion states. 16:9 landscape composition emphasizing horizontal flow and upward movement.

**Expected Output**: PNG 1920x1080, saved as `results/381-antigravity-gallery.png`
