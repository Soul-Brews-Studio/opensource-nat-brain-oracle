### Prompt

A lean figure hunched over in a library or archive, magnifying glass raised to eye level, rendered in ink-wash minimalism. Surrounding the detective are floating documents, threads, and connections—papers suspended in air connected by cyan light lines forming a web of relationships. The magnifying glass amplifies details, revealing hidden patterns in glowing cyan. Behind the figure, a wall of documents and filing cabinets fades into wash tones, suggesting endless material to explore. Gold light marks significant discoveries or key connections just revealed. Dust motes suspended in searchlight beams. The detective's posture is intense but patient—this is methodical work. Scattered at the figure's feet are discarded leads (darker ink) and confirmed findings (gold marks). The overall composition suggests layers of information being penetrated and organized. Thoughtful, investigative, persistent.
