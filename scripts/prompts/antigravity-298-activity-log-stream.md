# Activity Log Stream - Continuous Logging

## Thai Text
บันทึกกิจกรรม: ไหล → เก็บบันทึก → ติดตาม

(Activity Log: Flow → Record → Track)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash illustration of a figure standing in a flowing stream or river, recording moments as they
pass. The stream represents continuous time and activity flow, with visible current carrying events,
decisions, and moments downstream.

The figure holds a scroll or ledger that unrolls continuously, tracking every item that passes.
Semi-transparent cyan drops of water/moments fall into the ledger, each leaving a mark or entry.
Golden timestamps mark each entry point, creating a golden dotted line down the scroll.

The activity stream flows from left (past) to right (future), with the figure positioned to capture
the present moment. Background shows accumulated logs stacked as completed scrolls, creating a growing
archive of documented time.

Each activity entry rendered as a small symbolic item: checkmarks for completions, arrows for changes,
symbols for state transitions. Semi-transparent cyan groupings show activity clusters or batches.

The stream's velocity varies: calm sections (routine activities) shown with gentle flow, turbulent
sections (busy periods) shown with swirling energy. Golden highlights mark significant events or
decision points that stand out in the stream.

Include depth effect: events appearing upstream are rendered faintly (future), clearly visible in
present (center), and fading downstream (past). The scroll captures the "now" moment with most detail.

Background suggests a monitoring station or observatory with measurement tools visible. Monochrome
ink with geometric timeline frameworks.

Foreground shows completed activity logs sealed and filed, creating a growing library of documented
history. Each log labeled with date/time ranges and tagged by category.

Include visual representation of log query or search: thin threads pulling specific entries from the
stream for analysis, showing how historical data can be retrieved.

Style: River of time documentation, mindful observation, continuous presence.
