Create a professional, modern illustration for a technical workshop about CLAUDE.md (AI assistant guidelines).

Style: Clean, minimalist, tech-forward with warm human touch
Colors:
- Primary: Deep blue (#1e40af) for AI/technology
- Secondary: Warm orange (#f97316) for collaboration
- Accent: Mint green (#10b981) for growth
- Background: Soft cream (#fef3c7)

Composition:
- Left side: Stylized document icon labeled "CLAUDE.md" with visible text lines suggesting code/instructions
- Center: Flowing connection lines (like neural pathways or conversation bubbles) showing interaction
- Right side: Abstract representation of AI assistant (geometric shapes forming a friendly helper, NOT robot)
- Bottom: Small human figure at desk, collaboratively working with flowing lines connecting to AI

Visual elements:
- Document has visible sections: "Safety Rules", "Workflows", "Short Codes"
- Conversation bubbles showing fragments like "rrr", "nnn", "help me create"
- Soft glow around connection points suggesting active collaboration
- Clean typography for labels: "Collaborate", "Create", "Improve"

Mood: Collaborative, approachable, professional yet friendly
Avoid: Robots, generic chatbot icons, overly complex diagrams
Emphasis: Human-AI partnership, not replacement

Aspect ratio: 16:9 (suitable for presentation slide)
Resolution: High quality for projection

Text overlay (optional, can be added later):
"CLAUDE.md: Your AI Team Member's Guidebook"

Target audience: Technical professionals learning to work with AI
Purpose: Workshop slide header/hero image

Additional notes:
- Should work well as both full-color and when printed in grayscale
- Icons should be recognizable even at small sizes
- Overall feel: "This makes AI collaboration accessible and effective"
