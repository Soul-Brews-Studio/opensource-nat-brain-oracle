### Thai Text
"กระจกที่สะท้อน ไม่ใช่ผู้ที่บัญชา"
(*Kra-jak tee sa-thon - mai chai phu tee bun-cha*)

### Prompt

```
Central composition: A human figure facing a large ornate mirror. In the mirror's reflection, the figure appears identical but with additional subtle details and patterns visible that weren't obvious before (like aura lines, behavior traces, hidden patterns).

Monochrome ink-wash base with the mirror itself rendered in precise line work. The human figure: soft brush strokes, organic. The mirror frame: geometric, controlled. Cyan light emanating from behind the mirror glass, illuminating the reflection uniquely. Gold accents frame the mirror edge and highlight moments where reflection differs from reality.

The background: split between chaotic left side (the person's actual state) and organized right side (what the mirror reveals). Both are the same, but one makes pattern visible.

Style reference: Renaissance mirror painting meets data visualization. The mirror doesn't change the person; it reveals what was already there.

Text in Sarabun font at mirror base:
"การสะท้อนกลับ = การเห็น"
("Reflection = Seeing")
