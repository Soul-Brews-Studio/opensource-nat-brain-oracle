(Jot-mai-het - Khon-jot-ban-thuk)
*Note Taker - Scribe of Records*

### Prompt

A figure bent over parchment or paper, quill or brush in hand, frantically capturing fleeting thoughts and observations in ink-wash. The scribe's hand moves quickly but deliberately, creating elegant script and notation. Above the figure, thoughts and concepts float in ethereal cyan light—ephemeral wisps that the scribe races to capture before they vanish. Gold marks moments when important insights are successfully written down and preserved. Ink splashes and crossed-out lines show the urgency and imperfection of real-time capture. Crumpled papers and false starts surround the workspace—the scribe has been busy. The growing pile of written pages glows with gold accumulation—value building from many small captures. The background fades into white space, suggesting the endless stream of thoughts to record. The figure's expression shows focus and slight urgency—racing against the clock of consciousness. Quick, devoted, preserving, energetic.
