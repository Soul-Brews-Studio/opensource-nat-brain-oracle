# Pending Task Queue - WIP Tracking

## Thai Text
คิวรอ: เข้า → รอ → ออก

(Queue: Enqueue → Wait → Dequeue)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash queue or waiting room visualization showing a procession of task items lined up in organized
rows or columns, awaiting processing. Each task rendered as a distinct geometric container or card,
with semi-transparent cyan highlighting indicating priority or wait duration.

The figure stands at center, serving as the dispatcher or queue manager, gesturing items through
the system. A processing station visible on right side where tasks are actively being worked (fewer
items, more detail visible).

Visual gradient shows task aging: newest items at entrance (left side) rendered fresh and vibrant,
older waiting items progressively fading toward the back of queue, showing how long they've been waiting.
Some items glow with golden urgency indicators suggesting priority tasks that have been waiting too long.

Queue structure shows: intake funnel (new items arriving), main queue body (items waiting in order),
and dispatch exit (items being processed). Include depth-of-field effect suggesting infinite queue
extending into background.

Semi-transparent cyan bands mark queue sections: immediate (bright), short-term (medium), long-term
(dim). Include queue statistics: total count, wait times, priority distribution visible as overlays.

Background suggests a service counter or triage center with organized structure. Monochrome ink with
geometric frameworks representing ordered data structure.

Foreground shows task completion area on right: items being processed with visible work happening,
golden seals marking completion, finished items departing the system.

Include visual metaphor of task state transitions: arrival → waiting → processing → completion.
Text overlay: "First in, First out" or "By Priority".

Style: Service design meets data structure visualization, organized patience.
