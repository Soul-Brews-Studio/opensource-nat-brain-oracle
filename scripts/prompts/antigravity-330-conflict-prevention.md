# Conflict Prevention

## Thai Text
ป้องกันความขัดแย้ง
(Pong-gun Kwaam Kat-yaeng)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash composition showing a shield in center. Before the shield (left side): five agent figures with files/objects in hand attempting to merge toward center. The shield glows in gold rays creating a protective barrier. Above the shield: a checklist in monochrome with items being checked off in cyan and gold (pre-flight checks). Blocked conflict paths shown as dimmed/fading lines that turn away from the shield. One "approved" pathway shown in bright cyan flowing through shield center marked with gold checkmark. Surrounding area shows light wash suggesting calm, protected environment. Faint warning symbols appear near conflict paths (not overtly prominent). 16:9 aspect ratio emphasizing prevention and protection. Thai text "ป้องกันความขัดแย้ง" top center.
```
