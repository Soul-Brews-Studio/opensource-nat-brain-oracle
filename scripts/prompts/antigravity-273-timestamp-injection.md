# Timestamp Injection Flow

## Thai Text
การฉีด Timestamp: Hook เพิ่มเวลา

(Timestamp Injection: Hooks Add Time)

## Prompt
```
Vertical flowing diagram showing hooks injecting timestamps into passing data streams.
Monochrome ink wash background with geometric precision overlays.

Top: Data stream flowing downward as flowing ink line (cyan). At three points marked with
golden circles, hook functions branch off horizontally, each injecting a timestamp.

Each timestamp injection shown as:
- Golden needle-thin lines converging on the stream
- Cyan burst pattern showing the moment of injection
- Small time notation appearing on the data stream in delicate text

The data stream changes appearance as it accumulates timestamps - starts thin and clear,
becomes slightly thicker with each injection, carrying the weight of accumulated time markers.

Left margin: vertical timeline with traditional clock symbols in ink. Right margin: shows
the resulting data structure growing more complex visually as timestamps accumulate.

Center-bottom: magnified detail showing the internal structure of a timestamped event,
rendered as concentric circles with time markers radiating outward.

Style: Scientific diagram meets Eastern time philosophy visual. Heavy use of whitespace
to show clarity and precision. Ink wash clouds suggest data flow, geometric overlays
show exact structure.
