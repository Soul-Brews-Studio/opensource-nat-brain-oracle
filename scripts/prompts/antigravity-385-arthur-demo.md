### Prompt
A formal portrait-style composition rendered in ink-wash showing a humanoid AI form (abstract, composed of flowing lines and geometric shapes) in conversation stance. Black and gray tones create dimensional form. The figure has a luminous core center where cyan energy concentrates, representing consciousness or presence. Gold outline traces the figure's gesture lines - pointing, indicating, presenting. Around the figure, transparent floating panels show interface elements or demonstration screens, each ringed with cyan highlights. Speech or knowledge flows as visible cyan streams between the figure and surrounding elements. Gold accents mark moments of teaching or insight. The background fades into soft ink-wash suggesting a presentation stage or spotlight. Multiple perspectives or demonstration states shown simultaneously with transparency overlays. Thai text (Kanit font) in corner identifying capabilities or purpose. The overall mood is authoritative yet accessible, confident yet transparent. 16:9 landscape with figure positioned slightly left of center, plenty of air suggesting openness and clarity.
