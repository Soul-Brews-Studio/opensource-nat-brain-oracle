## 302: "Patterns Over Intentions" - Heatmap of Behavior vs Stated Goals

**Type**: image
**Target**: antigravity
**Status**: pending
**Category**: oracle-philosophy

### Thai Text
"การกระทำพูดได้ชัดกว่าคำพูด"
(*Kan kra-tum poot dai chet kwa kam poot*)

### Prompt

```
Divided composition: Left half shows a figure speaking with thought bubbles of intentions (stated goals in clean geometry). Right half shows a heatmap visualization of the same figure's actual movements/actions over time.

Monochrome ink-wash base with watercolor-style blooming effects. The intention side: clean line drawings, light grayscale, orderly geometry. The behavior side: dense heatmap with cyan intensity layers showing frequency/density of actual actions—warm zones show where person actually spent effort, cool zones show neglected areas.

Gold connecting lines between stated intention and actual behavior patterns, revealing gaps. The connecting lines progressively brighten where intention=behavior, fade where they diverge.

Style reference: Police detective board meets scientific thermal imaging. The contrast between clean intention and dense, chaotic behavior reality creates visual tension that reveals truth.
