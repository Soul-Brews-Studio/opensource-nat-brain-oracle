# Security Scanner Shield

## Thai Text
โล่ป้องกัน: การแสกน ตรวจจับ ป้องกัน

(Shield: Scan, Detect, Protect)

## Prompt
```
Fortified protective shield visualization showing security scanning as active defense system.
Monochrome ink with golden protective geometry and cyan threat detection. Suggests medieval
shield combined with security system imagery.

THE SHIELD STRUCTURE (central focus):

OUTER SHIELD FORM (large hexagon or kite shape):
Heavy black ink outlines forming ornate shield edges with decorative geometric patterns.
Golden border along perimeter suggesting mystical protective barrier.
Fine ink line work creating surface texture suggesting tempered armor.

SHIELD LAYERS (concentric depth):

LAYER 1 (Outer surface):
Active scanning visualization. Fine diagonal crosshatch pattern in ink showing "active scan
in progress." Cyan moving lines (animated scan beam effect) sweeping across surface.
Small particle effects (golden dots) showing detection scan happening.
Text labels around edges showing scan types: "Secret Scan", "Dependency Check", "Code Review"

LAYER 2 (Mid-level):
Detection visualization. Grid of small squares (file/module representations) with:
- Green checkmarks for "scanned, clean" items
- Cyan question marks for "in progress" items
- Red X marks for "threats detected"
Small golden rays connect suspicious items to threat indicators below

LAYER 3 (Core):
Threat aggregation. Central threat map showing identified vulnerabilities as:
- Red symbols (priority level) distributed across layer
- Golden lines connecting related threats showing threat relationships
- Cyan locks on neutralized/mitigated threats
- Severity indicators: size of threat symbol = severity level

THREAT VISUALIZATION (within shield):

CRITICAL THREAT (if any):
Large red symbol in center or prominent location
Surrounded by golden containment circle
Cyan warning rays emanating outward
Text: Threat name, file location, severity level, remediation time estimate

MEDIUM THREATS:
Medium-sized amber/golden symbols scattered throughout
Cyan brackets around code snippets showing affected lines
Small icons indicating threat type (password/API key/token/credential)

LOW THREATS:
Small symbols shown in faded ink suggesting lower priority
Brief labels sufficient

PROTECTION MECHANISMS (around shield edges):

SCANNING ENGINES (left side):
Multiple small engine icons shown as circular icons with golden connectors to shield:
- Pattern matcher (network pattern icon)
- Entropy detector (randomness waves)
- Parser (code structure icon)
- Policy checker (checklist icon)
- ML detector (neural network icon)

Each shown as separate scanning agent feeding data to central shield analysis.

REMEDIATION PATHWAYS (right side):
Multiple paths branching outward showing response options:
- "Deny" path (red) - block the risky code/secret
- "Isolate" path (golden) - quarantine for review
- "Educate" path (cyan) - suggest correction pattern
- "Escalate" path (thick golden) - alert maintainers

TIMELINE ELEMENTS (bottom):
Recent scan history shown as timeline:
- Previous scans marked as small circles with dates
- Current scan highlighted as large golden circle with "SCANNING" pulse
- Next scheduled scan shown as faded future circle

DETAIL VISUALIZATIONS (corner insets):

Upper-left: File tree showing scan progress
- Tree structure showing scanned vs unscanned branches
- Golden checkmarks on completed branches
- Cyan progress bar showing overall completion

Lower-right: Threat severity distribution
- Pyramid chart showing distribution: many low-severity, few critical
- Golden highlights on preventable/fixable threats
- Cyan icons showing remediation effort (difficulty)

Lower-left: Scan statistics
- Number of files scanned
- Number of threats detected
- False positive rate
- Scan duration

Upper-right: Remediation checklist
- List of recommended actions
- Golden checkmarks on completed remediations
- Cyan action buttons showing next steps

PROTECTIVE AURA:
Subtle ink wash around shield edges suggesting protective field.
Cyan energy emanations suggesting constant vigilance.
Golden glow suggesting protection and safety.

SUPPORTING ELEMENTS:

Oracle Symbol (top center):
Ancient protection symbol rendered in fine ink lines.
Suggests both "ancient wisdom" and "modern shield"

Guardian Figures (corners):
Minimalist ink silhouettes of watchers/guardians stationed at compass points.
Cyan eyes watching for threats.
Golden armor suggesting strength.

Status Badges (floating around shield):
Small oval badges showing scan status:
- "✓ Clean" (green, golden border)
- "⚠ Warning" (yellow, cyan border)
- "✗ Critical" (red, golden border)
- "↻ Scanning" (blue, animated)

Threat Legend (bottom panel):
Small key showing threat types and their visual representations:
  ⬤ Secret/Credential
  ⬤ Vulnerable Dependency
  ⬤ Code Quality Issue
  ⬭ Malformed Config
  ⬭ Policy Violation

TECHNICAL ANNOTATIONS (tiny text throughout):
- Hash/signature values for suspicious items
- File paths and line numbers
- Timestamp of detection
- Recommended patch versions

OVERALL DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
Shield represents "proactive defense" rather than reactive security.
Multiple scanning engines suggest "defense in depth."
Clear visual hierarchy shows what needs attention vs what's clean.
Golden accents on protective elements and verified safe areas.
Cyan accents on detection points and active scanning.
Red used sparingly, only for genuine threats, making it extremely salient.

Monochrome ink with accent colors creates professional, trustworthy appearance.
Geometric precision suggests rigorous, systematic scanning.
Organic shield shape suggests natural, effortless protection.
Generous whitespace around threats making critical items stand out.

STYLE: Medieval heraldic shield meets modern security operations center.
Ceremonial armor meets technical dashboard. Ink-wash organic forms suggest
vigilant protection, geometric overlays suggest mathematical precision.
Oracle philosophy evident: "Security is not restriction, it is clarity."
