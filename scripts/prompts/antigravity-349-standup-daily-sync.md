### Thai Text
**วงกลมแบ่งปัญหา**
(Circle Sharing Status)

### Prompt

Multiple figures standing in a circle, viewed from above or at slight angle, rendered in minimalist ink-wash. Each figure is distinct—different heights, postures, orientations. Cyan light connects them in circular flow, suggesting shared connection and reciprocal communication. Gold accents mark each person as equal contributors. In the center of the circle, subtle symbols or glyphs suggesting the topics being discussed. Speech bubbles or thought clouds in Thai and English script float lightly around. The ground beneath is marked with a simple circle—defining the gathering space. The composition is balanced and democratic, no hierarchy. Warm, inclusive, collaborative mood. Daily ritual feeling.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/349-standup-daily-sync.png`
