### Thai Text
**ลูกศรแยกออกเป็นสายน้ำ**
(Arrows Splitting into Streams)

### Prompt

A single powerful arrow or beam splitting into multiple parallel streams, rendered in ink-wash with cyan and gold accents. The origin point is bold and focused (gold), the splitting point is dynamic, and the resulting streams are cyan—each flowing in parallel but independent directions. Each stream has its own intensity and character, suggesting different agents with different tasks. The background shows minimal wash tones allowing the streams to be the focal point. Where streams interact or are near each other, there's subtle interference patterns. The composition moves left-to-right or top-to-bottom showing the branching and distribution of effort. No collision or conflict between streams—they move in harmony despite independence. Coordinated, energetic, distributed.

**Expected Output**: PNG (16:9) — `results/350-parallel-multi-agent.png`
