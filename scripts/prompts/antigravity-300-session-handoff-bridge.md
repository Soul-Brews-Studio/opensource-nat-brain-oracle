# Session Handoff Bridge - Transferring Between Sessions

## Thai Text
ส่งต่องาน: จดหมายเหตุ → สะพาน → ตื่น

(Handoff: Notes → Bridge → Awaken)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash illustration showing a bridge connecting two distinct islands or chambers, representing
session transitions. On the left island: a figure concluding current session, wrapping up work,
writing final notes. On the right island: a new figure awakening or beginning, reading handoff
documentation, preparing to resume.

The bridge itself is the focal point: constructed of golden threads and crystal-clear connections,
suggesting secure and complete information transfer. Semi-transparent cyan light illuminates the
bridge, showing the path of knowledge flowing from old session to new.

Left side (Current Session): Figure at desk with final documentation visible, reviewing what was
accomplished, noting what remains. Monochrome ink rendered workspace with completed work stacked
in golden-banded containers. Semi-transparent cyan indicators show session summary crystallizing.

Center (Bridge): Handoff documentation visibly flowing - scrolls, notes, state information carrying
across. Golden seals mark completed sections, cyan threads show dependencies and connections that
must be understood. Include symbolic representation: thought transfer, context passing, explicit
knowledge hand-to-hand.

Right side (New Session): Figure beginning work, reviewing handoff notes, understanding previous
session's findings. Workspace in setup phase, tools being arranged, context being absorbed. Semi-
transparent cyan highlights show comprehension and readiness occurring.

Supporting structure beneath bridge: foundational knowledge, shared context, persistent memory.
Rendered as geometric base with reference information visible.

Background suggests temporal passage: left shows sunset (session ending), right shows dawn (session
beginning), with bridge spanning the transition. Monochrome ink with geometric time-bridge frameworks.

Include visual metaphor: continuous thread or chain passing through the bridge, representing unbroken
continuity of work despite session boundaries. No information lost, only carefully packaged and handed.

Foreground shows the handoff moment: explicit gesture of passing responsibility, golden glow marking
the transfer point, new figure grasping understanding as old figure steps back.

Include documentation details visible: focus.md, context summary, action items, previous decisions,
learned patterns - all readable in the bridge crossing.

Style: Bridge architecture meets knowledge transfer, continuity amid change.
