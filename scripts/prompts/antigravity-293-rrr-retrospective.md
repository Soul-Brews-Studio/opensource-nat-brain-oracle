# RRR Retrospective Ritual - Session Reflection

## Thai Text
ทบทวนทบทวนทบทวน: ย้อนกลับ → สะท้อน → เรียนรู้

(RRR: Rewind → Reflect → Learn)

## Prompt
```
Ink-wash meditation scene showing a figure seated in contemplative pose, with concentric circular
layers radiating outward representing time periods and experiences. Each circle contains symbolic
representations of session activities: completed tasks, decisions made, surprises encountered.

The figure sits at center of a spiral timeline, reviewing events layer by layer. Semi-transparent
cyan arcs trace backwards through time, with each arc highlighting a specific session phase or
decision point. Golden threads connect related insights across layers, showing pattern recognition.

Above the figure, a vertical timeline flows from past (bottom) to present (top), with key moments
marked by small geometric indicators. Completed sessions shown as sealed scrolls with timestamps.

Surrounding the figure: floating documents, reflection prompts, learning symbols. Text elements
include: "What worked?", "What surprised?", "Pattern?", "Next?".

Background suggests a study or library with shelves of previous sessions' records. Monochrome ink
with geometric mandala-like pattern beneath the figure, representing cyclical learning.

Include progress indicator showing growth across sessions - subtle upward trend or increasing clarity
in the surrounding geometric patterns.

Foreground shows crystallized insights forming: abstract shapes solidifying from ephemeral moments,
suggesting knowledge solidification. Golden accents highlight "aha!" moments and pattern breakthroughs.

Style: Zen meditation meets data analysis, peaceful processing.
