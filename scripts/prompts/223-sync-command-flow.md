# Sync Command Flow - Synchronizing All Worktrees

## Thai Text
คำสั่งซิงค์ | การจัดตรงทั้งหมด

## Prompt
A monochrome ink-wash illustration showing multiple parallel timelines or branches (representing different worktrees) that are staggered and slightly out of alignment. A large golden wave or pulse flows horizontally across all branches from left to right (or from center outward), representing the sync command's action. Where the wave touches each branch, that branch realigns and glows with gold/cyan light. The synchronized branches form a unified pattern behind the wave. The composition uses repeating geometric patterns to show the before (chaotic/scattered) and after (aligned/unified) states. Small nodes along each branch represent commits, and they visually snap into alignment. The background features wash gradients showing motion and transformation. Include concentric circles or ripple patterns at the sync origin. Style: Wave propagation meets geometric precision.
