### Prompt

Ink-wash base in blacks and grays with a false-solid appearance. Central image: A figure standing confidently on what appears to be solid ground (rendered in gold-tinted ink) but the ground is actually ancient, cached memory—shown as translucent layers underneath that are slowly dissolving. Cyan water or light seeps through cracks in the supposedly-solid surface. The figure holds a glowing gold sphere (cached context) above their head like a sun, so bright they cannot see the ground beneath them. In the background, ink-wash shadows show other figures who ignored the warning and have already fallen through. The ground edge fades into white/unknown territory. Top text: "CONTEXT ≠ PROPHECY" with Thai: "บริบท ≠ ทำนาย"
