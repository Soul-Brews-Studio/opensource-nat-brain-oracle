"The Flood Detection Instrument"

### Prompt
A minimalist ink-wash illustration of rippling water captured in cross-section, showing horizontal wave patterns in darkest blacks against pure white. A small robotic sensor device (abstract geometric form) partially submerged at different water levels across the composition. Cyan flowing lines emanate from the device outward like sonar waves, tracking rising and falling liquid levels. Gold vertical markers indicate measurement thresholds on the right edge. Multiple transparent ink-wash layers create a sense of water depth and motion. Dry-brush texture showing water urgency and fluid dynamics. Abstract data columns in background showing rising/falling patterns. The device appears as a small orange geometric form (simplified cube-like shape) integrated into the water landscape. Minimal text overlays in Thai fonts (Kanit). 16:9 horizontal composition emphasizing flow from left (dry) to right (flooding).

**Expected Output**: PNG 1920x1080, saved as `results/382-floodboy-sensor.png`
