Open my Nat's Agents project in VS Code and start Claude CLI.

Project path: /Users/nat/Code/github.com/laris-co/Nat-s-Agents

Steps:
1. Open VS Code with this directory
2. Open a new terminal in VS Code
3. Start `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` in the project directory
4. Verify with `pwd` that we're in the right location

This is my main AI agents workspace where I develop Claude Code workflows, subagents, and workshop materials.
