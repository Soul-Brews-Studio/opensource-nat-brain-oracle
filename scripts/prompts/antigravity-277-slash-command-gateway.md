# Slash Command Gateway

## Thai Text
ประตู Slash: เข้าสู่คำสั่ง ทั้งหมด

(Gateway: Entry to All Commands)

## Prompt
```
Monumental gateway structure shown in ink wash and geometric line art. Central focus is
a large "/" symbol rendered as an ornate gate in traditional Asian architectural style.

THE GATEWAY STRUCTURE:
- Center: "/" symbol formed by two bold curved ink strokes, meeting at sharp point
- Golden geometric overlays create precise angles radiating from the "/" center
- Left pillar: Stream of input text flowing toward the gateway
- Right pillar: Multiple colored streams flowing outward representing routed commands

ENTRY POINT (left side):
Raw text input shown as flowing ink wash cloud entering the left pillar.
Cyan scanner lines analyze and parse the input as it flows toward gateway.
Small particles of light (golden dots) represent tokenization occurring.

THE PORTAL (center "/" structure):
Large central void/opening in the "/" where command routing occurs.
Golden concentric circles show the decision logic: which command category?
Multiple routes branch from this central point:
  - UPWARD: Blue/cyan tinted exit showing "skill" commands
  - RIGHTWARD: Purple-tinted exit showing "workflow" commands
  - DOWNWARD: Red-tinted exit showing "admin" commands
  - LEFTWARD: Green-tinted exit showing "utility" commands

EXIT STREAMS (right side):
Multiple branching paths flowing outward, each leading to different command processors.
Cyan and golden accents show active command execution paths.
Fading ink wash suggests ongoing execution in parallel streams.

SURROUNDING ELEMENTS:
- Top arch: Command categories in delicate text
- Bottom foundation: Authentication/validation checks shown as geometric seals
- Side walls: Cache indicators showing frequently used commands as golden highlights

STYLE: Japanese torii gate meets futuristic data flow visualization. Heavy use of
ink wash for mystery and elegance, geometric precision for technical clarity.
Monochrome base with accent colors indicating different command types/urgency levels.
