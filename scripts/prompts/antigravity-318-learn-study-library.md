### Prompt

A contemplative library rendered in ink-wash with tall shelves of reference books, cloned repositories, and study materials. Unlike the vault, this library is warm and intimate—reading spaces with comfortable seating, scattered notes, open books. Cyan light filters through tall windows creating reading pools. Gold accents mark particularly enriching or inspiring references. A scholar or reader sits with an open book, hand on chin, absorbed in learning. The library has a hushed, reflective quality—not a place of action but of understanding. Books are organized but also show evidence of browsing—stacks on tables, bookmarks, annotations. The air feels peaceful and safe. The composition emphasizes vertical organization but also the horizontal surfaces for reading and thinking. Contemplative, peaceful, generative mood. Learning as gift, not requirement.
