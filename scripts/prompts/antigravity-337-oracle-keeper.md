(Phu-rak-sa Prat-chah - Kep-rak-sa Nang-sue-saht)
*Oracle Keeper - Maintaining Philosophy*

### Prompt

An ancient sage seated cross-legged or standing before towering scrolls, manuscripts, and sacred texts in monochrome ink-wash rendering. The figure is illuminated by soft, internal gold light—suggesting wisdom and preservation. Scrolls unfurl around the keeper, each containing glowing cyan text or principles. The keeper's hands gently hold or copy from scrolls, maintaining and transmitting knowledge. Gold light marks the oldest, most precious manuscripts. Cyan pathways connect related philosophical concepts across the scroll collection. The background shows an infinite library or archive—shelves receding into white space suggesting endless wisdom to preserve. Dust particles hang in light beams. The figure's expression is serene, deeply focused, honoring the weight of custodianship. The scrolls themselves seem to glow with intrinsic value. The composition emphasizes stillness, preservation, continuity, and reverence. Wise, patient, sacred, timeless.
