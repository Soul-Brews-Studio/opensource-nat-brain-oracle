### Thai Text
"ความจริง มีค่ามากกว่า ความสม่ำเสมอ"
(*Khwam-jing mee-kha mak kwa khwam-som-sum*)

### Prompt

```
A human figure stands at a crossroads. Two paths diverge ahead. On the left path: smooth, flattering mirror surface reflecting only idealized version—rendered in soft, blurred pastels, ego-soothing geometry. On the right path: a clearer mirror showing unvarnished reality—sharp details, honest representation, some uncomfortable truths visible.

The human figure leans toward the right path despite difficulty.

Composition: Path splits from center with figure at the fork. Left path dissolves into soft fog. Right path appears more solid, challenging, but leads toward distant light (gold/cyan).

Monochrome ink-wash base. The flattering mirror on left: blurred, overly soft, pastel-like reflections that obscure. The honest mirror on right: sharp, precise line work showing actual patterns, frequencies, growth edges.

Cyan energy flows along the right path despite resistance. Gold accents mark moments of honest recognition.

The figure's heart area glows cyan—showing the courage it takes to choose truth over comfort.

Style reference: Dante's crossroads meets character development arc—the harder path containing more light.

Text in Kanit font at the fork:
"ความสบายใจ vs ความเจริญ"
("Comfort vs Growth")
